The greenback keeps the positive mood near 97.70. German IFO disappointed expectations for the current month. Poor results from the German docket motivated EUR/USD to briefly drop below the critical support at 1.1200 the figure, where it is now looking to consolidate. EUR/USD remains offered near YTD lows Spot came under further downside pressure and staged an ephemeral break below the 1.1200 handle after the German IFO came in below estimates in all of its components for the current month. In fact, Business Climate dropped to 99.2 (from 99.6), Current Assessment slipped back to 103.2 (from 103.8) and Business Expectations decreased a tad to 95.2 (from 95.6), once again confirming the view of the slowdown in the domestic economy and in the broader euro region. Earlier in the week, ECB&rsquo;s B.Coeure admitted the deceleration of the German economy had been stronger than initially forecasted, although he advocated for a rebound in the second half of the year if there is a US-China trade agreement. What to look for around EUR The broad-based risk-appetite trends and USD-dynamics are posed to rule the sentiment surrounding the European currency for the time being, all in combination with the onoging US-China trade dispute and potential US tariffs on EU products. Recent weak results from key fundamentals in the region plus a now unlikely rebound in the activity in the second half of the year have added to the ongoing concerns that the slowdown in the region could last longer that expected and the ECB is therefore likely to remain &lsquo;neutral/dovish&rsquo; for the foreseeable future (say until mid-2020?). On the political front, headwinds are expected to emerge in light of the upcoming EU parliamentary elections in late May, as the populist option in the form of the far-right and the far-left movements appears to keep swelling among voting countries. EUR/USD levels to watch At the moment, the pair is losing 0.13% at 1.1212 and faces initial contention at 1.1192 (low Apr.23) seconded by 1.1183 (low Apr.2) and finally 1.1176 (low Mar.7).

The greenback clinches YTD peaks beyond 97.80. Yields of the German 10-year Bund falls into negative ground. The selling pressure in the single currency is now picking up further traction and forces EUR/USD to challenge the vicinity of yearly lows in the 1.1180 region. EUR/USD faces a deeper retracement The sentiment around EUR continues to deteriorate this week on the back of a change of heart towards the greenback from investors, poor results in Euroland and negative performance of German yields. In fact, yields of the German 10-year benchmark slipped back to the negative territory, widening the gap vs. their US peers to the 254 pts and at the same time adding to the already rising pessimism after the German IFO survey missed consensus for the current month.

While the greenback is among the top performers of the day, the Euro is also losing ground against the Pound and the Swiss Franc. The Euro is falling for the second-day in-a-row against the US dollar. It weakened earlier today after the release of EZ economic data (German IFO Survey) and also affected by the move in German bonds. The 10-year fell to negative territory, widening the gap against the US 10-year that stands at 2.53% (at 2-week lows). The US Dollar is up today against majors and also versus emerging markets and commodity currencies. The DXY stands at 97.77 after hitting at 97.85, the highest level since June 2017.

EUR/USD is currently trading at 1.1163 and between 1.1153 and 1.1226. There is a mixed risk appetite in markets where risk-off flows have benefitted the greenback, in part related to Brexit and Italian government risks, then USA trade policy risk and a pop in oil which was related to the USA&rsquo;s Iran policy has kicked-in to the price of FX in recent sessions. However, the euro has long been scrutinised over the economic performance in the EZ, subsequently dragging on the sentiment from the ECB. For instance, last week, the EUR bulls ended up bitterly disappointed when the German manufacturing PMI Index which proved that it remains deep in contraction territory (at 44.5 in April). German IFO kicks bulls in the teeth when already down Then, today&#39;s IFO sealed the fate for the euro earlier today - as a result, core eurozone yields dipped and the euro eventually played catch up weakening from above the 1.1250s. This surprise drop in the activity in Germany highlights the divergence between economic data in the United States and the eurozone and should keep the euro under pressure for sessions ahead, at least until US durable goods and GDP later this week. EUR/USD levels Bulls needed to get above both the 55 and 100 day moving averages at 1.1291/1.1342 but fundamentals have weighed in.

The dollar will likely remain bid on growing US-Eurozone economic divergence. An above-forecast US durable goods data may hasten the drop to 1.10. The EUR/USD pair took a beating yesterday, courtesy of the broad-based US dollar demand. The pair closed fell 0.66 percent &ndash; the biggest single-day drop since March 22. Further, the spot closed at 1.1153 &ndash; the weakest daily close since June 2017.More importantly, with a convincing close below 1.1176 (March 7 low), the shared currency has established a new lower low, validating the bearish lower high created at 1.1324 earlier this month. As a result, a deeper drop toward 1.10 could be seen &ndash; more so, as the German 10-year bond yield has again dropped below zero. Indeed, the 10-year treasury yield has also dropped nearly 10 basis points in the last ten days and may continue to lose ground as most major central banks have recently adopted dovish stance. Even so, the dollar will likely remain bid as the persistent rise in stock markets coupled with the upbeat macro data releases makes the Fed more and not less likely to tighten, as stated by BK Asset Management&rsquo;s Kathy Lien. Note that the upbeat March US retail sales figures released last week convinced many that the economy did well in the first quarter than previously thought. That belief would strengthen further, leading to a further drop in EUR/USD toward 1.10, as suggested by charts, if the US data, due today at 12:30, shows the spending on durable goods rebounded sharply in March, having dropped 1.6 percent in February.

The EUR/USD pair remained depressed through the mid-European session and dropped to fresh 22-month lows, around the 1.1130 region in the last hour. Having consolidated in a narrow range during the early part of Thursday&#39;s trading action, the pair came under some renewed selling pressure since the early European session and extended its recent bearish trajectory for the third consecutive session. The already weaker sentiment surrounding the shared currency deteriorated further after the ECB, in its monthly economic bulletin for April, reiterated that risks to the Euro-zone economic growth remains tilted to the downside and ample degree of accommodation is still needed. This comes against the backdrop of growing concerns of a sharp economic slowdown in the region&#39;s largest economy, triggered a steep decline in German bond yields overnight. In fact, the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond remained in the negative territory and continued affecting the shared currency in a negative manner. Adding to this, a follow-through US Dollar upsurge to the highest level since June 2017, supported by the recent positive US economic data, further collaborated to the pair&#39;s heavily offered tone/the ongoing slump further below mid-1.1100s.

The US Census Bureau is scheduled to release the monthly report at 12:30 GMT and consensus estimates point to a goodish bounce during the reported month and show a 0.8% m/m rise following a steep decline o 1.6% recorded in the previous month. Excluding transportation items - core durable goods orders, which tend to have a broader impact than the volatile headline figures are anticipated to rise 0.2% in March as against a downwardly revised reading of -0.1% previous. As Joseph Trevisani, FXStreet&#39;s own Senior Analyst explains: &ldquo;Several factors point to a better than expected durable goods result in March. The economy has performed well in the first quarter. Despite low initial estimates for GDP, beginning in early March at less than 0.5% annualized, the most recent forecast from the Atlanta Fed GDPNow model is 2.8%. Equities have soared to record or near record highs this month based largely on excellent corporate earnings reports. Retail sales in March were much stronger than predicted, 1.6% vs 0.9% in the overall number and 1.0% s 0.4% in the control group.&rdquo; Deviation impact on EUR/USD Readers can find FX Street&#39;s proprietary deviation impact map of the event below. As observed, the reaction is likely to be in the range of 20-25 pips during the first 15-minutes in case of a deviation from +0.36 to -0.51 and could extend up to 51-55 pips in the following 4-hours. EUR/USD important levels to watch Yohay Elam, FXStreet&#39;s own Analyst offers some important technical levels ahead of the important release: &ldquo;The fresh 2019 and a 22-month low of 1.1140 is the first line of support. 1.1115, 1.1025, and 1.0900 all date back to 2017. Resistance awaits at the previous yearly trough of 1.1176, followed by 1.1205 that was a swing low in early April, 1.1230 that was a separator of ranges before the recent downfall, and 1.1285 that capped EUR/USD recently.&rdquo; Key Notes &bull;US Durable Goods Preview: Where the consumer leads &bull;EUR/USD Forecast: Down but not out, oversold conditions can trigger a recovery &bull;EUR/USD continues losing ground, falls to fresh multi-month lows ahead of US durable goods About US durable goods orders The Durable Goods Orders, released by the US Census Bureau, measures the cost of orders received by manufacturers for durable goods, which means goods planned to last for three years or more, such as motor vehicles and appliances. As those durable products often involve large investments they are sensitive to the US economic situation. The final figure shows the state of US production activity. Generally speaking, a high reading is bullish for the USD.EUR/USD Technical Analysis: Consolidating above 1.1118-1.1109 support bandEUR/USD is resting above the 1.1118-1.1109 support band amid oversold readings on the hourly and 4-hour chart relative strength index. Repeated defense of that support line could yield a minor bounce, which could end up recharging fuels for a deeper drop below 1.10, as the pair dived out of the multi-month trading range of 1.12-1.15 earlier this week, putting the bears in a commanding position. Weekly chart The falling trendline, representing lower highs and the downward sloping 5- and 10-week moving averages (MAs) indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside. A weekly close below 1.1176 would only bolster the already bearish technical setup, strengthening the case for a drop to 1.10. A close above the 10-week MA would neutralize the bearish setup. 4-hour chart As seen above, the RSI is reporting the oversold condition. So, the spot may hold the 1.1118-1.1109 support band for the next few hours. A decisive break lower could happen if the US first-quarter GDP prints well above estimates. The data is scheduled for release at 12:30 GMT. It is worth noting that markets have bought US dollars over the last five trading days, possibly in anticipation of upbeat GDP. As a result, the GDP figure will have to beat expectations by a big margin to push the greenback higher.

The sentiment around the shared currency remains fragile so far this week, although EUR/USD has managed to rebound somewhat from yesterday&rsquo;s 2019 lows near 1.1120. EUR/USD now looks to US data After three consecutive daily pullbacks &ndash; including a visit to June 17 lows in the 1.1120/15 band - the pair is now seeing some relief in the 1.1140 area, where some consolidation trading turned up. The deteriorated mood around the riskier assets in combination with miserable prints from the euro docket has been plotting against any serious attempt of recovery in spot as of late, all aggravated at the same time by auspicious results across the pond, which rendered in extra oxygen to the buck. Moving forward, the pair is posed to stay under further scrutiny in light of the upcoming release of the first revision of US GDP for the January-March period along with the final print of Consumer Sentiment for the month of April. What to look for around EUR The broad-based risk-appetite trends and USD-dynamics are posed to rule the sentiment surrounding the European currency for the time being, all in combination with the onoging US-China trade dispute and potential US tariffs on EU products. Recent weak results from key fundamentals in the region plus a now unlikely rebound in the activity in the second half of the year have added to the ongoing concerns that the slowdown in the region could last longer that expected and the ECB is therefore likely to remain &lsquo;neutral/dovish&rsquo; for the foreseeable future (say until mid-2020?). On the political front, headwinds are expected to emerge in light of the upcoming EU parliamentary elections in late May, as the populist option in the form of the far-right and the far-left movements appears to keep swelling among voting countries. EUR/USD levels to watch At the moment, the pair is up 0.07% at 1.1138 and a breakout of 1.1233 (21-day SMA) would target 1.1282 (55-day SMA) en route to1.1323 (high Apr.17). On the downside, the next support aligns at 1.1118 (2019 low Apr.25) seconded by 1.0839 (monthly low May 11 2017) and finally 1.0569 (monthly low Apr.10 2017).EUR/USD: Focus on US GDP, US dollar vulnerable to sell the fact tradeEUR/USD remains on the defensive, having found acceptance below 1.176. The recent surge in dollar index suggests markets may have priced-in a better-than-expected Q1 US GDP. EUR/USD may see a corrective bounce post-GDP. EUR/USD may see a corrective bounce if the preliminary first-quarter US GDP reading matches or fails to beat expectations by a big margin. The upbeat US retail sales data released a week ago pointed to a stronger economy in the first three months than previously expected. Notably, the widely-tracked Atlanta Fed&#39;s GDPNow trackerrose to 2.8 percent following the release of the retail sales data, having begun the year with a 0.3 percent projection for the first quarter. As a result, the American dollar has been better bid right from the start of the current week. This is evident from EUR/USD&rsquo;s drop from the high of 1.1324 seen on April 17 to a 22-month low of 1.1118 yesterday. Further, the dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against majors, has risen from 97.18 to an 11-month high of 98.32 over the last few days. Put simply, investors seem to have priced-in an above-forecast GDP reading. The data due at 12:30 GMT is expected to show the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 2.1 percent in the first quarter, having registered a growth rate of 2.2 percent in the preceding quarter. The EUR/USD pair could see a corrective bounce if the GDP fails to beat expectations by a big margin (Atlanta Fed&rsquo;s GDPNow tracker sees growth rate at 2.7 percent). The common currency, however, may slide below 1.11 if the GDP prints above 3 percent.
