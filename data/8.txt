Apart from this, the downtick wasn&#39;t backed by any obvious fundamental catalyst and hence, lacked any strong follow-through as investors start repositioning for Friday&#39;s US jobs report, popularly known as NFP. &ldquo;Expectations for the US Non-Farm Payrolls have risen following the blockbuster increase of 275K in private sector jobs, as published by ADP on Thursday. The consensus of economists, as shown in the FXStreet calendar, stands at around 180K,&rdquo; Yohay added further. Technical outlook Valeria Bednarik, FXStreet own American Chief Analyst writes, &ldquo;the pair is at risk of extending its decline, as, in the 4 hours chart, technical indicators keep easing, the Momentum barely holding above its mid-line and the RSI currently challenging the 50 level. The price seesaws around a bullish 20 SMA, while the larger ones gain downward traction above the current levels. The bearish case will be firmer on a break below 1.1190, a Fibonacci support.&rdquo;EUR/USD slumps below 1.12, focus shifts to Friday's key dataBusiness activity in Germany&#39;s manufacturing sector contracts in April. US Dollar Index extends rebound, closes in on 98. Coming up on Friday: Inflation data from the eurozone and the NFP from the U.S. Following its 4-day long rally to a fresh two-week high of 1.1265, the EUR/USD pair reversed its direction and erased a large part of this week&#39;s gains with the greenback capitalizing on the FOMC Chairman Powell&#39;s optimistic remarks. As of writing, the pair is trading at 1.1180, losing 0.12% on a daily basis. Earlier today, the data from Germany showed that the business activity in the manufacturing sector contracted with the IHS Markit&#39;s Manufacturing PMI coming in at 44.4 and falling short of the market expectation of 44.5. Other data from Germany revealed that retail sales in March declined by 0.2% on a monthly basis. Although the Manufacturing PMI for the eurozone improved to 47.9 in the same period, it failed to help the shared currency recover its losses. In the meantime, the greenback continued to outperform its rivals supported by the FOMC Chairman Powell&#39;s optimistic remarks about the economic outlook and his view of inflation slowdown being temporary, which is taken as a sign thatthe Fed is not seeing soft inflation as a cause for a rate cut. The US Dollar Index built on yesterday&#39;s sharp rebound and rose to a daily high of 97.85 today. On Friday, the inflation report from the euro area, which is expected to show that the Consumer Price Index on a yearly basis rose to 1.6% in April from 1.4% in March, will be looked upon for fresh impetus before the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes its highly-anticipated Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report. NFP leading indicators: ADP Employment report and ISM Manufacturing PMI hint mixed signals.

Key Points: Sees &#39;material risk&#39; of a higher USD in May. A turnaround of two key themes that have driven risk rallies in past months. The positives were: Rebounding China Dovish Fed Go short EUR/USD, volatility to increase in May.EUR/USD: Techs lean bearish ahead of US non-farm payrollsEUR/USD is on the defensive, having charted a bearish lower high at key trendline hurdle earlier this week. Recent lows near 1.10 will likely be put to test if the US wage growth tops forecasts. EUR/USD will likely revisit the recent low of 1.1110, as suggested by technical charts, if the US non-farm payrolls and more importantly, the wage-price inflation, scheduled for release at 12:30 GMT today, blows past expectations. The currency pair faced rejection at the trendline connecting March 20 and April 17 highs earlier this week after the Fed kept the interest rates unchanged and Chairman Powell pushed back expectations that the central bank&#39;s next move would be a rate cut by associating low inflation with transitory factors. Powell added further that the policymakers see no strong case for a move in either direction. More importantly, EUR/USD closed well below 1.1187 on Thursday, validating the post-Fed sell-off. With a bearish lower high in place along the descending trendline, the path of least resistance appears to be on the downside. The recent lows near 1.11, therefore, stand exposed and could be put to test if the US data surprises on the higher side. The Nonfarm Payroll figure is expected to show the economy added 185k jobs in April, following the addition of 196K jobs in March. Meanwhile, the average hourly earnings are forecasted to increase by 0.3% month-on-month in April, following a 0.1% rise in March. An above-forecast wage growth data would force markets to scale back expectations of Fed rate cut in December, leading to a broad-based rally in the US Dollar. Ahead of the Fed, the EUR/USD could take cues from German Bundesbank President Weidmann&#39;s speech (due at 08:00 GMT) and the preliminary Eurozone consumer price index for April, scheduled for release at 09:00 GMT.

Analysts, however, predict that the greenback will begin losing ground later, eventually pushing EUR/USD to 1.18 in 12 months from now. The currency pair is currently trading at 1.1175. It is worth noting thatanalysts in Reuters polls have been wrongfooted for nearly two years in their predictions for a weaker dollar.EUR/USD: Bounce losing upside momentum - CommerzbankKaren Jones, analyst at Commerzbank, suggests that the EUR/USD pair has held over the 1.1110, the May 2017 low but seems to be losing upside momentum just ahead of the 55 day ma at 1.1274. Key Quotes &ldquo;Market may need to consolidate further, intraday Elliott wave counts are contradictory. For now, we are unable to rule out a retest of the 1.1110 support. Be advised that the pattern being traced out is a potential large reversal pattern, we have divergence of the weekly RSI and a 13 count on the weekly chart as well and there is a risk of reversal.&rdquo; &ldquo;Support at 1.1110 is regarded as the break down point to 2018-2019 support line (connects the lows) at 1.1059, the 1.0963 TD support and the 1.0814/78.6% retracement.&rdquo; &ldquo;Initial resistance is the 100 day ma at 1.1329 and the resistance line at 1.1356 ahead of the 200 day ma at 1.1413. Only above the 200 day ma would this imply reversal.&rdquo;EUR/USD flirting with session lows, around mid-1.1100s despite hotter than expected Euro-zone CPI&bull; The headline/core CPI is estimated to have risen by 1.7% and 1.2% y/y rate respectively. &bull; Better than expected CPI figures did little to provide any respite to the shared currency. &bull; Traders seemed reluctant to place any aggressive bets ahead of the US monthly jobs report. The EUR/USD pair held on to its mildly weaker tone through the early European session and moved little post-Euro-zone consumer inflation figures. According to the preliminary report, the Euro-zone headline CPI is estimated to rise by 1.7% y/y rate in April as compared to 1.4% recorded in the previous month and core CPI is also seen edging higher to 1.2% y/y rate during the reported month from 0.8% previous. The readings were better than consensus estimates, albeit did little to provide any immediate respite to the shared currency. The pair remained on the defensive for the third consecutive session and seems all set to extend this week&#39;s post-FOMC retracement slide from near two-week tops. Investors, however, seemed reluctant to place any aggressive bets ahead of today&#39;s important release of the closely watched US monthly jobs report (NFP), which might influence the near-term US Dollar price dynamics and eventually provide some fresh directional impetus to the major. Technical levels to watch According to Yohay Elam, FXStreet&#39;s own Analyst: &ldquo;Initial support awaits at 1.1140 which was a temporary support line in mid-April. The 2019 trough of 1.1110 is a critical support line. The next line, 1.1025, dates back to June 2017, nearly two years ago.&rdquo; &ldquo;Looking up, 1.1220 capped a recovery attempt recently. The high of 1.1265 seen on Wednesday is a significant resistance line. It is followed by 1.1325 that was a stubborn cap in mid-April,&rdquo; he added further.Eurozone flash CPI rises to 1.7% y/y in April, beats estimates (EUR unmoved)According to Eurostat&rsquo;sflash reading ofEurozone CPI report, the annual reading came in at 1.7% in April, beating expectations of 1.6% and 1.4% previous. Meanwhile, the core figures also rose to 1.2% in the reported month when compared to 1.0% expectations and 0.8% previous. Key Details (via Eurostat): &ldquo;Looking at the main components of euro area inflation, energy is expected to have the highest annual rate in April (5.4%, compared with 5.3% in March), followed by services (1.9%, compared with 1.1% in March), food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (1.5%, compared with 1.8% in March) and non-energy industrial goods (0.2%, compared with 0.1% in March).&rdquo; The Eurozone inflation report comes a couple of days after the German Prelim CPI data was released, which showed that the German consumer price inflation accelerated and bettered expectations in April, although remained in line with the European Central Bank&rsquo;s (ECB) rate target of just under 2 percent for theEurozoneas a whole.When is the US monthly jobs report (NFP) and how could it affect EUR/USD?US jobs report overview Friday&#39;s US economic docket highlights the release of closely watched US monthly employment details, popularly known as NFP. The report is scheduled to be released at 12:30GMT and is expected to show that the US economy added 185K new jobs during the month of April, lower than the previous month&#39;s headline print of 196K. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.8% during the reported month but the key focus will be on wage growth data, which have gained more traction in the recent past. Average hourly earnings are foreseen to rise by 0.3% m/m, while the yearly rate is anticipated to tick higher to 3.4% rate. Deviation impact on EUR/USD Readers can find FX Street&#39;s proprietary deviation impact map of the event below. As observed, the reaction to the headline NFP print, in case of a relative deviation of -1.23 or +0.98, is likely to be in the range of 54-52 pips during the first 15-minutes and could stretch to 105-90 pips in the subsequent 4-hours. How could the data affect EUR/USD? Ahead of the key release, Yohay Elam, FXStreet&#39;s own Analyst offers important technical levels to trade the major: &ldquo;Initial support awaits at 1.1140 which was a temporary support line in mid-April. The 2019 trough of 1.1110 is a critical support line. The next line, 1.1025, dates back to June 2017, nearly two years ago.&rdquo; &ldquo;Looking up, 1.1220 capped a recovery attempt recently. The high of 1.1265 seen on Wednesday is a significant resistance line. It is followed by 1.1325 that was a stubborn cap in mid-April,&rdquo; he added further. Key Notes &bull;Non-Farm Payrolls Preview: Don&#39;t speak of gloom, show me &bull;US NFP Preview: Major Banks expectations from April payrolls report &bull;EUR/USD Technical Analysis: On offers for the third straight session, set-up in favor of bearish traders About the US monthly jobs report The nonfarm payrolls released by the US Department of Labor presents the number of new jobs created during the previous month, in all non-agricultural business. The monthly changes in payrolls can be extremely volatile, due to its high relation with economic policy decisions made by the Central Bank. The number is also subject to strong reviews in the upcoming months, and those reviews also tend to trigger volatility in the forex board. Generally speaking, a high reading is seen as positive (or bullish) for the USD, while a low reading is seen as negative (or bearish), although previous months reviews and the unemployment rate are as relevant as the headline figure, and therefore the reaction depends on how the market asses them all.EUR/USD refreshes weekly lows post-NFP, but lacks follow-through on softer wage growth data&bull; The US economy added 263K new jobs in April; unemployment rate drops to 3.6%. &bull; Softer average hourly earnings data does little to provide a strong boost to the USD. &bull; Market participants now eye Fedspeaks for some meaningful trading opportunities. The EUR/USD pair maintained its offered tone through the early European session and refreshed weekly lows, below mid-1.1100s post-NFP. The US monthly jobs report showed that the US economy added 263K new jobs during the month of April, much better than the previous month&#39;s headline print of 196K and surpassing even the most optimistic estimates. Adding to this, the unemployment rate unexpectedly declined to 3.6% from 3.8% previous, though was partly offset by slightly weaker than expected wage growth data. In fact, average hourly earnings grew by 0.2% m/m as against 0.3% expected and held the yearly rate to 3.2% during the reported month. The wage growth data did little to reaffirm the Fed Chair Jerome Powell&#39;s comments made that subdued inflation appears to be transitory, albeit a modest uptick in the US Treasury bond yields provided a goodish lift to the US Dollar and kept exerting downward pressure on the major. With today&#39;s slide for the third straight session, the pair has now dropped back closer to YTD lows and remained on track to end the week on a downbeat note &ndash; possibly for the third consecutive week of losses. Moving ahead, scheduled speeches by a slew of influential FOMC members will now be looked upon to reinforce Powell&#39;s view on transitory low inflation, which might eventually influence the USD price dynamics and further collaborate towards producing some meaningful trading opportunities on the last day of the week.

EUR/USD rebounds sharply from weekly lows and turns positive for the week. The EUR/USD pair bottomed at 1.1133 immediately after the release of the non-farm payroll report, reaching the lowest level in a week. Afterward, the US Dollar weakened across the board and pushed the pair to the upside. Recently after the US PMI Markit report rose further and hit a fresh daily high at 1.1193. The euro erased yesterday&rsquo;s losses and is in positive territory for the week. The main driver has been the decline of the US dollar. The DXY reversed sharply and dropped from near 98.00 to 97.63. The last leg lower was boosted after the release of the US Services PMI that hit the lowest since March 2017 at 53.0, down from 55.3 previously. &ldquo;April data signalled a slower increase in business activity across the U.S. service sector. Output rose at the softest pace since March 2017 as new business growth also eased to a two-year low. Despite a further increase in backlogs of work, firms reined in their hiring, with the rate of job creation slowing to a two-year low. Uncertainty and increased competition meanwhile pushed business expectations to the lowest for almost three years, while rates of input price and output charge inflation eased to 26- and 18-month lows, respectively&rdquo;, said Markit in the report. Previously, the NFP showed an increase of 263K in April, significantly above expectations. The Unemployment Rate unexpectedly dropped to 3.6% while Average hourly earnings rose by 0.2% below the 0.3% estimated. Initially, the dollar jumped but a few minutes later reversed sharply. The EUR/USD is now in positive territory for the week. The bounce from the weekly low was capped below 1.1200 but the Euro remains near the top with the bullish tone intact as the bearish pressure on the greenback persists. Above the next resistance is seen at 1.1230 (20-day moving average).EUR/USD upside capped by 1.1200 despite upbeat dataThe pair flirts with session lows near 1.1180. Sentix turned positive for the current month. EMU Retail Sales surprised to the upside in March. The offered bias around the European currency remains well and sound at the beginning of the week, with EUR/USD now trading closer to daily lows in the 1.1180/70 band. EUR/USD negative despite data Spot has resumed the downside on Monday, giving away part of Friday&rsquo;s advance following the publication of US Non-farm Payrolls, which despite showing a solid job creation, wage inflation pressure failed to gather serious traction. EUR stays on the defensive today on the back of the re-emergence of trade jitters on the US-China trade front and comments by President Trump. The pair stays apathetic despite the Sentix index, which measures investors&rsquo; confidence in the euro bloc, improved to 5.3 for the month of May. In the same line, Retail Sales in the region came in flat on a monthly basis in March (vs. a forecasted 0.1% drop) and expanded 1.9% from a year earlier, bettering expectations. Moving forward and in the US docket, Philly Fed P.Harker (2020 voter, hawkish) will speak on Economic Outlook ahead of the releases of Producer Prices and the CPI later in the week. What to look for around EUR Recent data in Euroland and Germany allowed market participants to believe that some healing process could be under way in the region amidst the ongoing slowdown. However, this scenario needs confirmation in the next months, while the current &lsquo;neutral/dovish&rsquo; stance from the ECB is expected to persist for the reminder of the year and probable H1 2020. The broad-based risk-appetite trends and USD-dynamics are posed to rule the sentiment surrounding the European currency for the time being, all in combination with the onoging US-China trade dispute and potential US tariffs on EU products. On the political front, headwinds are expected to emerge in light of the upcoming EU parliamentary elections in late May, as the populist option in the form of the far-right and the far-left movements appears to keep swelling among voting countries. EUR/USD levels to watch At the moment, the pair is losing 0.11% at 1.1188 and faces the next support at 1.1109 (2019 low Apr.26) seconded by 1.0839 (monthly low May 11 2017) and finally 1.0569 (monthly low Apr.10 2017). On the other hand, a break above 1.1264 (high May 1) would target 1.1271 (55-day SMA) en route to 1.1323 (high Apr.17).EUR/USD Technical Analysis: Scope for another test of 2019 lows near 1.1100EUR/USD comes under further downside pressure at the beginning of the week on the re-emergence of US-China trade concerns and the subsequent pick up in the risk aversion. Immediately to the upside aligns last week&rsquo;s tops in the 1.1270/80 band along with the 55-day SMA. Spot needs to clear this hurdle in order to mitigate the downside pressure somewhat. Looking at the broader picture, the negative bias should remain intact below the multi-month resistance line, today near 1.1320. That said, another test of YTD lows in the 1.1100 neighbourhood remains well on the cards.

The initial risk-off tone appears to have subsided somewhat during the European afternoon, with EUR/USD managing to regain some composure around the 1.1200 region. EUR/USD keeps looking to trade for near term direction Spot has managed to abandon the area of daily lows near 1.1180 amidst some recovery in the risk appetite trends, while a drop on US-GE yield gap is also collaborating with the rebound in the pair. In fact, yields of the US 10-year reference dropped to fresh lows in the sub-2.50% area, taking the spread differential vs. their German peers to the lower bound of the range around 247 pts, favouring the bullish attempt in spot at the same time. In the meantime, all eyes remain on the US-China trade negotiations (or absence of them) as the almost exclusive drivers of the price action so far this week. Earlier in the session, positive results from the euro docket saw the Sentix index and Retail Sales in Euroland coming in above expectations, also supporting the shared currency somehow. Across the pond, the speech by Philly Fed P.Harker (2020 voter, hawkish) on Economic Outlook should keep the attention on the buck ahead of the publication of Producer Prices (Thursday) and the CPI (Friday).

Earlier in the day, the data published by the Eurostat showed that retails sales in the euro area stayed unchanged in March to come in slightly better than the market expectation for a decline of 0.1%. Additionally, the IHS Markit&#39;s Services PMI came in a 52.8 in April&#39;s final reading to better the market forecast of 52.5. Finally, Sentix Investor Confidence in May rebounded to 5.3 from -0.3 in April. &quot;Fears of a recession are thus receding into the background, which is reflected in the improved situation values in all the regions considered. We can also report further stabilisation for the eurozone,&quot; Sentix noted in its publication. On the other hand, escalating geopolitical tensions amid fears of the U.S. and China staying locked in a trade dispute weighed on the market sentiment and didn&#39;t allow the pair to gain traction. With the greenback capitalizing on risk-off flows, the US Dollar Index erased a portion of last Friday&#39;s drop and was last up 0.1% on the day at 97.60. On Tuesday, factory orders data from Germany will be looked upon for fresh impetus. The only data from the U.S. will be the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index. Technical outlook by FXStreet Chief Analyst Valeria Bednarik The pair trades just a few pips above the 38.2% retracement of its latest daily slide, seesawing around a mild bearish 20 SMA in the 4 hours chart. The 100 and 200 SMA in the mentioned chart maintain their bearish slopes above the current level, while technical indicators are stuck to neutral levels without directional strength. The upcoming direction will likely come from equities&#39; reaction to weekend news, as further indexes declines could end up benefiting the greenback.

In annualized terms, factory orders are forecasted to drop 6.2% in March following an 8.4% slide in February. That would be the tenth consecutive monthly decline. Data may disappoint expectations The headline IHS Markit/BME Germany Manufacturing PMI had dropped sharply in March to 44.1, the lowest level since July 2012, from 47.6 in February. The deterioration was underpinned by a sharp and accelerated decrease in new orders, primarily the ones from abroad. The slide in foreign demand may have once again weighed over factory orders. It is worth noting that the 4.2% slide in factory orders (the biggest since January 2017) registered in February was largely due to anemic external demand. Put simply, the probability of the data missing expectations is high. Impact on EUR/USD A weaker-than-expected release could complicate EUR/USD&#39;s plans to re-test the resistance of the trendline connecting March 20 and April 17 highs. As of writing, that trendline hurdle is seen at 1.237 and the EUR/USD pair is trading at 1.1206. The shared currency may pick up a strong bid and cut through the trendline resistance if factory orders better estimates by a big margin.
