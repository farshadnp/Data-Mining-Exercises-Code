amid Easter holiday-thinned quiet trading. The spot attempted a tepid bounce from the weekly lows of 1.1227 after the Euro got hammered across the board on disappointing German and Eurozone manufacturing PMI numbers that re-ignited Euro area growth concerns. Adding to the downside in EUR/USD, the US dollar caught a fresh bid-wave across the board on above-forecast US retail sales data. The macro data divergence between the Eurozone and the US continues to remain in favor of the USD bulls. Looking ahead, the recovery attempt in the pair, courtesy of broad USD pullback on Mueller&rsquo;s report, appear shallow, as the technically the pair remains exposed to the downside risks, with the yearly lows at 1.1177 seen as the next likely target. More so, the recent in-fighting within the Italian government over the graft scandal could also weigh negatively on the shared currency and keep the upside attempts limited.

US Dollar Index preserves Thursday&#39;s gains. Eurozone consumer sentiment data next week will be the next catalyst. The EUR/USD pair paid no mind to the housing market data from the United States at the start of the NA session. With the trading volume staying thin amid the Easter holiday, the pair continues to move sideways near mid-1.12s and looks to close the day with small gains. On a weekly basis, the pair is losing around 50 pips, reflecting the negative impact of the disappointing Manufacturing PMI data from Germany and the eurozone on the shared currency. Commenting on the eurozoneApril PMI reports, &quot;The persistence of the business survey weakness raises questions over the economy&rsquo;s ability to grow by more than 1% in 2019,&rdquo;Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at the IHS Markit, said. Today&#39;s only data from the U.S. revealed that housing starts and building permits in March declined by 0.3% and 1.7%, respectively, and both readings came in worse than analysts&#39; estimates. Nevertheless, the US Dollar Index, which gained traction in the second half of the week with the risk-off atmosphere ramping up the demand for the greenback, continues to float above the 97.30 mark, not allowing the pair to stage a recovery. On Monday, the FX market activity is expected to stay subdued with the majority of Europe observing Easter Monday. The next catalyst for the shared currency could be the eurozone Consumer Confidence report published by the European Commission on Tuesday.

The Atlanta Fed&#39;s GDPNow tracker rose to 2.8 percent last week vs 0.3 percent at the start of the year. EUR is on the defensive, having suffered a bullish channel breakdown last week. EUR/USD may drop to fresh year-to-date lows below 1.1176 in the near term, as the recent US economic data releases have pointed to a stronger economy in the first three months than previously expected. The consumer spending, as represented by retail sales, surged 1.6 percent in March &ndash; the fastest pace in a year and a half &ndash; the official data released last week showed. Further, jobless claims hit fresh multi-decade low, meaning consumer spending may remain strong in the coming months. The Atlanta Fed&#39;s GDPNow tracker, which began the year with a 0.3% projection for the first quarter, rose to 2.8 percent last week following the release of the upbeat retail sales data. The official data scheduled for release at 12.30 GMT on Friday is expected to show the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 1.5 percent in the first three months of 2019, having registered a growth rate of 2.9 percent in the final three months of 2018. The 1.0% discrepancy between the general forecast and the Atlanta Fed&rsquo;s GDPNow projection of 2.8% leaves a great deal of room for a better than expected performance, according to FXStreet Analyst Joseph Trevisani. The FX markets could price in the possibility of an above-forecast US GDP in the run-up to Friday&rsquo;s release by sending the greenback higher across the board. EUR/USD is already trading on the defensive, having dived out of a bullish channel last week and could print fresh year-to-date lows below 1.1176 this week. The Eurozone PMIs released last week showed the manufacturing activity in the 17-nation economy deteriorated in April. So, the EUR bulls are unlikely to step in to defend the recent lows.

The greenback stays sidelined below recent tops. Markets in Europe are closed due to Easter Monday. EUR/USD keeps navigating the lower end of the recent range near 1.1240 following last week&rsquo;s rejection from tops beyond 1.1300 the figure. EUR/USD hurt by data, looks to USD Following last week&rsquo;s multi-day highs above the 1.1300 handle, the pair has sparked a correction lower on the back of a renewed momentum favouring the buck and poor prints in the euro calendar. In fact, April&rsquo;s advanced manufacturing PMIs in Euroland published last Thursday have once again disappointed investors and poured cold water over any hope of a pick up in the region. Combined with this, yield spread differentials between US bonds and German Bunds have resumed the upside and moved closer to 255 pts in the wake of recent strong prints in the US docket, all adding extra legs to the down move in spot. With most European markets closed due to Easter Monday, the next risk event in the area will be the release of the German IFO survey on Wednesday. Across the pond, the performance of the housing sector during March will be in the limelight in the first half of the week, with the publication of Existing Home Sales later today and New Home Sales on Tuesday. What to look for around EUR The broad-based risk-appetite trends are posed to rule the sentiment surrounding the European currency for the time being, while the onoging US-China trade dispute and potential deal expected to remain in centre stage in the next weeks. Recent weak results from key fundamentals in the region plus a now unlikely rebound in the activity in the second half of the year have added to the ongoing concerns that the slowdown in the region could last longer that expected and the ECB is therefore likely to remain &lsquo;neutral/dovish&rsquo; for the foreseeable future (say until mid-2020?). On the political front, headwinds are expected to emerge in light of the upcoming EU parliamentary elections in late May, as the populist option in the form of the far-right and the far-left movements appears to keep swelling among voting countries. EUR/USD levels to watch At the moment, the pair is up 0.01% at 1.1241 and a breakout of 1.1323 (high Apr.17) would target 1.1338 (200-week SMA) en route to 1.1341 (100-day SMA).

EUR/USD posed for a deeper pullback EUR/USD last week dropped to multi-day lows in the 1.1230/25 band amidst rising open interest and volume. While low volatility is expected to remain in centre stage today, the probability of a visit to lower levels stays well on the cards in the very near term.EUR/USD Technical Analysis: The pair&#8217;s outlook remains bearish below 1.1380, resistance lineThe pair navigates the area just above last week&rsquo;s lows in the 1.1230/25 band. EUR/USD failed to extend the rally beyond the 1.1320 area in past session, just ahead of the key resistance at the 200-week SMA near 1.1340. Further downside cannot be ruled out while below the key 6-month resistance line, today at 1.1380. That said, another visit to YTD lows in the 1.1180/70 band remains well on the cards in the short-term horizon.

It peaked at 1.1261, reaching the highest level since Thursday and is posting gains for the second-day in-a-row. Still remains far from Thursday&rsquo;s level when it traded close to 1.1300 before falling sharply following weaker-than-expected Eurozone economic data. Euro up across the board The move to the upside in EUR/USD was boosted by a modest correction in the DXY. Many European markets remain closed today while in the US, equity prices are posting mixed results. Economic data from the US had no impact. The DXY is down 0.10% at 97.25. Regarding the euro, it is among the top performers. EUR/CHF broke above 1.1425 to the highest since early February, while EUR/GBP approached April highs that reached last week at 0.8680. In the EZ, the next relevant economic report will be on Wednesday with the German IFO survey while in the US on Friday, Q1 GDP data is due.

They forecast EUR/USD at 1.16 (Q3 - 2019) and 1.20 (Q1 2020). Key Quotes: &ldquo;Retreating macro expectations have compromised ECB rate expectations. We&rsquo;ve seen front Euribor contracts rallying between 4-8 bps since the start of the year, while the EUR short positional skew has almost doubled in that time.&rdquo; &ldquo;While external trade tensions continue to weigh upon the eurozone, domestic demand dynamics, encouraged by a modest fiscal easing, remain much more resilient. Hence, while German manufacturing sentiment weighs disproportionately upon the pan euro metric, services sentiment is benefitting from rising wage growth. Positive domestic dynamics will likely influence the ECB&rsquo;s assumptions that the recent retreat in activity is transitory, and set to rebound into H2. Should global trade pressures dissipate into H2, expect this to disproportionately benefit the eurozone via Germany.&rdquo; &ldquo;Against the backdrop of an excessive short positional skew and rising wage pressures, expect the latter to encourage a rebound in core CPI. At the same time, reversing the downtrend in long-run inflation expectations favours a modest but gradual recovery in eurozone growth, implied rate assumptions and for the EUR.&rdquo;EUR/USD Technical Analysis: On the defensive with a bear flag on 4H chartEUR/USD&#39;s bounce from Thursday&#39;s low of 1.1226 has ended up creating a bear flag pattern on the 4-hour chart. A break below the lower edge of the flag, currently at 1.1243, would open up downside toward 1.1145 (target as per the measured move method). The EUR/USD pair is currently trading at 1.1250, representing a 0.10 percent drop on the day, having gained 0.10 percent and 0.15 percent in the previous two trading days. Both the US retail sales for March and the weekly jobless claims released last week suggested the world&#39;s biggest economy did well in the first three months of 2019 than previously thought. As a result, the markets may put a bid under the greenback later today, yielding a flag breakdown on EUR/USD. 4-hour chart Trend: Bearish below 1.1243 EUR/USD Overview Today last price 1.125 Today Daily Change -0.0007 Today Daily Change % -0.06 Today daily open 1.1257 Trends Daily SMA20 1.125 Daily SMA50 1.1294 Daily SMA100 1.1346 Daily SMA200 1.1436 Levels Previous Daily High 1.1264 Previous Daily Low 1.1236 Previous Weekly High 1.1324 Previous Weekly Low 1.1224 Previous Monthly High 1.1448 Previous Monthly Low 1.1176 Daily Fibonacci 38.2% 1.1253 Daily Fibonacci 61.8% 1.1247 Daily Pivot Point S1 1.124 Daily Pivot Point S2 1.1223 Daily Pivot Point S3 1.1211 Daily Pivot Point R1 1.1269 Daily Pivot Point R2 1.1281 Daily Pivot Point R3 1.1298EUR/USD: 10-yr US-DE yield spread hits four-month high in EUR-negative mannerThe US-German bond yield spreads continue to rise in the EUR-negative manner. The common currency could take a beating if the Eurozone consumer confidence, due later today, prints well below estimates, validating the dovish ECB expectations. EUR/USD could feel the pull of gravity today as the spread between the yields on the 10-year US and German government bond yields continue to rise in the EUR-negative manner. The yield spread, which stood at 241 basis points on March 22, rose to 259 basis points on Friday, the highest since December, possibly, in response to the data released on the preceding day, which showed the US consumer spending, as represented by the retail sales, rose 1.6 percent in March, the fastest pace in a year and a half, pointing to a stronger economy in the first quarter than previously expected. The two-year spread, which is more sensitive to short-term rate hike bets, has also increased by nearly 30 basis points over the last four weeks and could rise even further if the Eurozone data, due for release at 14:00 GMT, shows the consumer confidence deteriorated in April. That would further weaken the prospects of the ECB rate hike. The US housing data for April and the Richmond Fed manufacturing index, due at 14:00 GMT, could also influence the pair. An upbeat data may further bolster the speculation that the US economy is regaining its lost mojo, sending the greenback higher across the board. Further, the decision by the US to force the Iranian oil imports to zero and the resulting rise in oil and geopolitical uncertainty could weigh over equities and add to the bearish tone around the EUR. In any case, a big move in EUR/USD looks overdue, as the three-month at-the-money volatility has dropped to the lowest since June 2014. Technically speaking, that big move could happen to the downside if the bear flag, asseen in the 4-hour chart - a bearish continuation pattern - is breached to the downside. EUR/USD is currently trading largely unchanged on the day just above 1.1250.

US-EU macro divergence favors US-DE yield spread. Focus remains on the US new home sales and Eurozone consumer confidence. The bears are seen taking back charge in the European session, now pushing the EUR/USD pair towards the lower bound of today&rsquo;s trading range near 1.1250 region, as markets prefer to hold the US currency amid widening 10-year US-German (DE) government bond yield spread. The rise in the US-DE yield differential is mainly in response to the US-Eurozone macro data divergence, especially after the latest upbeat US retail sales report eased the US economic growth concerns while the disappointing German and Eurozone manufacturing PMI numbers re-ignited Euro area slowdown fears. It&rsquo;s worth noting that &ldquo;the yield spread, which stood at 241 basis points on March 22, rose to 259 basis points on Friday, the highest since December&rdquo;, Omkar Godbole, FXStreet&rsquo;s Analyst explains. In the day ahead, the shared currency remains exposed to further downside bias should the Eurozone consumer confidence data, due at 1400 GMT, deteriorate in April and weigh further on a potential ECB rate hike. Also, of note remains the US new home sales data for fresh dollar trades. From a technical perspective also, &ldquo;that big move could happen to the downside if the bear flag, asseen in the 4-hour chart - a bearish continuation pattern - is breached to the downside&rdquo;, Omkar adds.

Resistance awaits at 1.1210 and 1.1260 that the pair visited earlier. The bearish trend resumed earlier, and it has now caught fire. The US Dollar is on the rise after traders have returned from the long Easter break. The monetary policy divergence between the US and the rest of the developed world boosts the greenback across the board. The most recent US indicator, New Home Sales, came out at 692K annualized, better than had been expected and showing that America&#39;s housing sector has overcome the temporary slowdown. The upbeat US data contrasts weak European data. The most striking figure was Markit&#39;s German Manufacturing PMI which showed deep contraction in what is considered the continent&#39;s locomotive. The most recent number from the euro-zone showed consumer confidence dropping to -7.9 points, reflecting growing pessimism. Euro-zone finance ministers are especially concerned about Italy, the third-largest economy.

According to Haresh Menghani, Analyst at FXStreet, &ldquo;A convincing break through the mentioned support, around the 1.1185-75 region, is likely to accelerate the slide towards 1.1120 intermediate support en-route the 1.1100 round figure mark. A follow-through selling has the potential to drag the pair further towards the 1.1060-50 support, representing a descending trend-line extending from August 2018 swing lows.Alternatively, a sustained move back above the 1.1225-30 region might trigger a short-covering bounce and lift the pair beyond the 1.1255-60 supply zone towards testing another short-term descending trend-lineresistance, just ahead of the 1.1300 handle.&rdquo; Key Notes Germany: Downside risks for the IFO report - TDS EUR futures: further retracement on the cards German IFO and BoC amongst market movers today &ndash; Danske Bank About the German IFO Business Climate This German business sentiment index released by theCESifo Groupis closely watched as an early indicator of current conditions and business expectations in Germany.
