Key Quotes &ldquo;We have triple divergence of the weekly RSI which reflects a loss of downside momentum.&rdquo; &ldquo;The market has held support offered by 1.1110 May 2017 low AND we have a 13 Tom DeMark count on the weekly chart.&rdquo; &ldquo;All of these factors imply that a likely bullish reversal is imminent.&rdquo; &ldquo;A weekly close above 1.1346 would complete the reversal pattern and should then trigger gains to the 1.1473 55 week moving average and eventually to the 1.1815 September 2018 high.&rdquo;EUR/USD remains weak but still above 1.1200Euro consolidates losses against US dollar, on a quiet US session. Bearish pressure still remains in place in EUR/USD. The EUR/USD pair bottomed after the beginning of the US session at 1.1202 and then tested daily lows but remains on top of 1.1200. The bias continues to point to the downside. The euro weakened earlier today following the release of the ZEW survey that showed lower than expected numbers for Germany and the Eurozone. It extended the decline later on the back of a stronger US dollar against majors. The DXY is up 0.20% recovering from weekly lows. Despite rising versus European currencies, the greenback is modestly lower against emerging market currencies. The improvement in risk sentiment in Wall Street, where the DOW JONES is up 1.30% after yesterday&rsquo;s slide, is helping the demand for EM currencies but not the euro. Trade tensions between the US and China remain the main theme. Amid the lack of improvement in trade talks and with higher tariffs in place in the US, the deal does not look closer. Today US President Trump again defended its trade policy of higher tariffs. EUR/USD Levels to watch Price actions remains limited in the EUR/USD pair, moving since May 6 in a range of less than a hundred pips. To the downside, the immediate support is the 1.1200 area followed by 1.1185 and 1.1160 (last week low). While to the upside, if the euro manages to rise back above 1.1220, it would remove the intraday negative tone Above, resistance levels are seen at 1.1240/45 (daily high) and 1.1260.When is German GDP data and how could it affect EUR/USD?German GDP overview German gross domestic product (GDP) due at 06:00 GMT is forecasted to show the economy expanded 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of 2019.The growth rate had stalled in the final quarter of 2018.The annualized GDP is forecasted to rise 0.7% in the first quarter, having risen by 0.9% in the final three months of the previous year. Weak German growth rate priced in That German economy has slowed down considerably over the last few quarters is generally accepted by now and seems to have been pricedin by markets.This is evident from the fact that EUR/USD has dropped from 1.1570 to 1.11 in the first five months of this year despite the rising odds of Fed rate cut. German growth picked up pace in the first quarter Having narrowly escaped recession in the second half of 2018, German economy is widely forecasted to have picked up pace in the first quarter of 2019.This is because China&rsquo;s economy stabilized in the first three months and German consumer spending, as represented by retail sales, ticked higher. Impact on EUR/USD EUR/USD is on the defensive, having validated Monday&rsquo;s bearish inverted hammer with a close below 1.1222 on Tuesday.Essentially, the upside break of the trendline connecting March 20 and April 17 highs confirmed on Friday failed to entice buyers and the pair ended up carving another bearish lower high at 1.1263. The pair, therefore, looks set to test 1.1176 (March 7 low) and could slide further if Germany reports a weaker-than-expected rebound in growth rate.The losses could be limited around 1.1176 if German GDP matches estimates, while a move above 1.1263 could be seen if the growth rate beats expectations by a big margin. A dailyclose above 1.1263 would invalidate the bearish lower highs pattern and allow a stronger rally toward the 200-day moving average, currently lined up at 1.1397. The bulls, however, may struggle to force a daily close above 1.1263, courtest of heightened US-China trade tensions. About German GDP The Gross Domestic Product released by theStatistisches Bundesamt Deutschlandis a measure of the total value of all goods and services produced by Germany. The GDP is considered as a broad measure of the German economic activity and health. A high reading or a better than expected number has a positive effect on the EUR, while a falling trend is seen as negative (or bearish).EUR/USD: Topside still favoured - CommerzbankAxel Rudolph, analyst at Commerzbank, points out that the EUR/USD pair has reached the 55 day moving average at 1.1254 and they continue to favour the topside even though short-term further consolidation below the current May high at 1.1264 is expected to be seen. Key Quotes &ldquo;We expect the cross to remain above the March and early April lows at 1.1183/77. Unexpected failure there would put the 1.1110 April low back on the map. Be advised that the pattern being traced out is a potential large bullish reversal pattern.&rdquo; &ldquo;We have positive divergence on the weekly RSI and a Tom DeMark 13 count on the weekly chart. Overhead lie the 100 day ma at 1.1315 and the September-to-May resistance line at 1.1333. Further up meanders the 200 day moving average at 1.1396.&rdquo; &ldquo;Support at 1.1110 is regarded as the break down point to the 2018-2019 support line at 1.1099 and the 1.0814 78.6% Fibonacci retracement.&rdquo;German prelim GDP arrives at +0.4% in Q1, matches expectations (EUR unfazed)The German economy expanded by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2019 and matched expectations, the preliminary report by Destatis showed this Wednesday. Meanwhile, the yearly growth rate slowed more than expected to 0.6% as compared to the previous reading of 0.9%. The German GDP growth rate had stalled in the final quarter of 2018.&ldquo;Having narrowly escaped recession in the second half of 2018, the German economy is widely forecasted to have picked up pace in the first quarter of 2019.This is because China&rsquo;s economy stabilized in the first three months and German consumer spending, as represented by retail sales, ticked higher, &ldquo; FXStreet&rsquo;s Analyst Omkar Godbole noted.EUR futures: remains under pressure, probable reboundAccording to preliminary figures for EUR futures markets from CME Group, investors trimmed their open interest positions by around 3.5K contracts on Tuesday from Monday&rsquo;s final 509,005 contracts. Volume, instead, rose for the second session in a row, this time by just 820 contracts. EUR/USD a deeper pullback is not ruled out Shrinking open interest amidst declining prices could remove some strength from further decline in EUR/USD, allowing for a rebound in the near term. However, rising volume is still expected to favour extra retracements.EUR/USD recedes from tops, targets 1.1200 post-German GDPThe pair loses some upside momentum on German GDP figures. German flash Q1 GDP came in at 0.4%, in line with consensus. EMU advanced Q1 GDP figures coming up next. The single currency is fading part of the initial optimism and is now prompting EUR/USD to return to the boundaries of 1.1200 the figure in the wake of German data releases. EUR/USD looks to data, trade Spot eased some ground after preliminary readings for GDP figures in Germany showed the economy is expected to expand at a quarterly 0.4% during the January-March period and 0.6% on an annualized basis, somewhat disappointing market expectations. The riskier assets, and EUR, have regained some poise following renewed hopes of a US-China trade deal on Wednesday and have practically ignored below-consensus figures from the Chinese calendar published earlier in the Asian session. Moving forward, flash prints from EMU Q1 GDP will keep the attention on the shared currency later in the session, while Retail Sales and the NY Empire State index will be salient releases across the pond along with speeches by FOMC&rsquo;s R.Quarles and T.Barkin. What to look for around EUR Recent data releases in Euroland and Germany have poured cold water over the idea that some healing process could be under way in the region, re-shifting the focus to the ongoing slowdown and its likely duration and extension. In the meantime, the current &lsquo;neutral/dovish&rsquo; stance from the ECB is expected to persist for the reminder of the year and probable H1 2020. The broad-based risk-appetite trends and USD-dynamics are posed to rule the sentiment surrounding the European currency for the time being, all in combination with the onoging US-China trade dispute and potential US tariffs on EU products. On the political front, headwinds are expected to emerge in light of the upcoming EU parliamentary elections in late May, as the populist option in the form of the far-right and the far-left movements appears to keep swelling among voting countries. EUR/USD levels to watch At the moment, the pair is gaining 0.03% at 1.1206 and a break above 1.1264 (high May 1) would target 1.1313 (100-day SMA) en route to 1.1323 (high Apr.17). On the downside, immediate support aligns at 1.1176 (monthly low Mar.7) seconded by 1.1135 (low May 3) and finally 1.1109 (2019 low Apr.26).EUR/USD Technical Analysis: Room for a deeper retracement. Targets monthly lows near 1.1130The pair is struggling to defend the 1.1200 area following the recent pick up in the selling pressure. The key resistance area in the 1.1260/70 band &ndash; where coincide recent tops and the 55-day SMA &ndash; continues to cap the upside and if it is not cleared in the near term, sellers are likely to return to the markets. In the broader picture, EUR/USD stays offered below the key multi-month resistance line at 1.1299. That said, the door for another visit to 2019 lows in the 1.1100 neighbourhood remains well open.

EUR/USD cautious on trade, US data The pair is posting some decent gains following two consecutive daily pullbacks, managing to come back after piercing 1.1200 the figure during early trade. EUR is deriving some mild support from alleviated tensions on the US-China trade front today, although the cautious stance prevails among market participants for the time being. In the meantime, the single currency stays under pressure in light of today&rsquo;s disappointing figures from advanced GDP figures in both Germany and the broader euro area, adding to Tuesday&rsquo;s poor readings from Economic Sentiment in those same regions.

Meanwhile, the pair&#39;s inability to capitalize on the recent positive move and repeated failures near 50-day SMA now seemed to have constituted towards the formation of a bearish double-top chart pattern on short-term charts. Oscillators on daily/4-hourly charts have been gaining negative momentum and point to an extension of the ongoing slide, albeit slightly oversold conditions on the 1-hourly chart warrant some caution for bearish traders. Hence, it would be prudent to wait for a convincing break below the mentioned trend-line support before confirming a near-term bearish breakdown and positioning for a slide back towards challenging yearly lows, around the 1.1100 handle.

Improvement in risk appetite also helping EUR/USD move higher. The EUR/USD pair rose from levels near daily lows to 1.1224, hitting a fresh daily high. Then pulled back, being unable to hold on top of the key short-term level at 1.1220 and as of writing is hovering around 1.1200, marginally lower for the day but off daily lows. Earlier today, following the release of mixed US economic data, the pair bottomed at 1.1176, the lowest level since last Thursday. Retail sales in April dropped unexpectedly while industrial production contracted. The data had a limited impact. The move to the upside in EUR/USD took place after Bloomberg reported that US President Trump was planning to delay tariffs on European car imports for six months. The report also pushed equity prices to the upside. In Wall Street, main stock indexes are in positive territory after opening with losses. Despite the recovery, EUR/USD remains with a bearish bias, as it was unable to hold on top 1.1220. On the flip side, the area around 1.1165 and 1.1175 is a critical support: a break lower could lead to further losses, exposing the next support at 1.1135/40.EUR/USD: Auto tariffs delay helps put in a floor - TD Securities&quot;Press reports indicate the Trump Administration will delay its &quot;Section 232&quot; tariffs on autos and parts for up to six months,&quot; TD Securities analysts note. Key quotes &quot;This comes amid increased trade tensions with China and only days before a 18 May deadline on whether the Administration would proceed. Risks remain that this report is premature. We remain cautious until a formal announcement is made and will monitor the situation closely.&quot; &quot;If confirmed, this delay should help draw a line under potential EURUSD weakness. The situation remains highly fluid, but we have long considered a potential pivot in trade conflicts to Europe as one of the greatest near-term downside threats to EUR.&quot; &quot;An official announcement should help return the focus in EURUSD back to more traditional fundamentals. Here, we note the region&#39;s macroeconomic backdrop has improved in recent weeks. Indeed, &quot;hard data&quot; surprises have turned increasingly positive. We will need to see if this generates sustained gains in (real) bund yields, however, while the 6 June ECB meeting is the next major event risk. For now, 1.1175 (+/-) is a key pivot. Unless a new bearish catalyst emerges, the 26 April low (1.1112) could represent the trough for this cycle.&quot;EUR/USD technical analysis: Euro consolidating near 1.1200 after knee-jerk reaction on Trump commentEarlier on Wednesday, it has been reported that US President Trump was planning to delay tariffs on European car imports for six months. EUR/USD jumped to the 1.1223 level on the comment. EUR/USD remains stuck near the notorious 1.1200 figure with a bearish bias.

Italy&#39;s Salvini criticized the EU&#39;s budget deficit rules on Wednesday. Trump to delay the decision on auto import tariff. The widening Italy-German yield differential, however, may cap gains in the EUR. With Italy-German bond yield differentials hitting multi-month highs, the EUR/USD pair may have a tough time cheering reports of Trump delaying the decision on auto tariffs. European Union budget regulations are &quot;starving the continent&quot; and must be changed, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on Wednesday, according to Reuters and added further that Rome should break the EU&#39;s ceiling of 3% debt-to-GDP ratio and push debt to 140% of GDP, if required, to lower unemployment. Salvini&#39;s comments sent Italian bond prices lower. Notably, the spread between the Italian and German two-year government bond yields rose to 140 basis points on Wednesday, the highest level since December. The 10-year yield differential also widened to a 3.5-month high of 284 basis points. That likely capped gains in the EUR/USD pair, which ended largely unchanged on the day at 1.12, having hit a high of 1.1225 after news hit the wires that Trump is planning to delay the decision on auto imports by six months. The EUR/USD pair is currently trading at 1.1208. Italy&#39;s stance on the EU&#39;s budget rules will likely keep Italian bond prices under pressure. As a result, the Italy-German yield spread could continue to rise in the EUR-negative manner. Also, investors may continue to sell risk in response to Trump&#39;s decision to curb Huawei&#39;s access to both US markets and US suppliers. Hence, the probability of the pair falling below the trendline connecting April 26 and May 3 lows is high. At press time, the trendline support is located at 1.1181. On the higher side, Monday&#39;s high of 1.1263 is the level to beat for the bulls. Apart from yield differentials and broader market sentiment, the EUR/USD could also take cues from German Bundesbank President and the European Central Bank member Weidmann&#39;s speech, scheduled at 08:15 GMT today.

Trade, data, Italy, all keep weighing on the shared currency. ECB-speak, EMU trade balance, EuroGroup meeting in the limelight. After dropping to the 1.1180 region on Wednesday, EUR/USD managed to regain buying interest and it has once again regained the 1.1200 neighbourhood, where it is now looking to consolidate. EUR/USD stays vigilant on Italy, looks to ECB The pair is up smalls at the time of writing, always orbiting around the key 1.1200 handle and against a fragile backdrop following US-China trade concerns, renewed effervescence in the Italian political scenario and ahead of speeches by ECB officials. In fact, Italy is back in centre stage in response to the recent confrontation between leaders of the populist ruling party M.Salvini and L. Di Maio over the likeliness that Rome could break European spending limits. These renewed tensions have echoed in Italian money markets, widening the gap vs. their German peers and adding further downside pressure to the shared currency. In addition, trade concerns on the US-China front remain well and sound despite the lack of fresh headlines, while President Trump said on Wednesday the White House will wait around 6 months to come up with a decision regarding tariffs on US imports of autos and parts. Later in the European docket, EMU trade balance figures for the month of March are due ahead of the Eurogroup meeting and speeches by ECB&rsquo;s Board members P.Praet, Luis De Guindos and B.Coeure. Across the pond, housing sector data is due along with Initial Claims and the key Philly Fed index. What to look for around EUR Recent data releases in Euroland and Germany have poured cold water over the idea that some healing process could be under way in the region, re-shifting the focus to the ongoing slowdown and its likely duration and extension. In the meantime, the current &lsquo;neutral/dovish&rsquo; stance from the ECB is expected to persist for the reminder of the year and probable H1 2020. The broad-based risk-appetite trends and USD-dynamics are posed to rule the sentiment surrounding the European currency for the time being, all in combination with the onoging US-China trade dispute and potential US tariffs on EU products. On the political front, headwinds are expected to emerge in light of the upcoming EU parliamentary elections in late May, as the populist option in the form of the far-right and the far-left movements appears to keep swelling among voting countries. EUR/USD levels to watch At the moment, the pair is gaining 0.07% at 1.1208 and faces the next support at 1.1176 (monthly low Mar.7) seconded by 1.1135 (low May 3) and finally 1.1109 (2019 low Apr.26). On the other hand, a break above 1.1264 (high May 1) would target 1.1311 (100-day SMA) en route to 1.1323 (high Apr.17).EUR/USD Technical Analysis: Stays fragile below the resistance line at 1.1287EUR/USD manages to rebound from weekly lows near 1.1180 and has retaken the 1.1200 barrier, although the recovery lacks of conviction for the time being. The critical resistance zone remains in the 1.1260/70 band, where converge recent peaks and the 55-day SMA. Spot should clear this area in the near term, otherwise sellers are likely to return to the markets. In the meantime, EUR/USD remains offered below the key multi-month resistance line at 1.1287. Against this backdrop, another visit to YTD lows near 1.1100 remains well on the cards.

The EUR/USD pair struggled to capitalize on its early uptick and momentarily slipped below the 1.1200 handle in the last hour to refresh session lows. The optimism over US car tariff delay turned out to be short-lived and the pair failed to build on the overnight goodish bounce, rather now seemed to be facing some stiff resistance near the 1.1225 region amid concerns over Italy&#39;s debt situation. It is worth reporting that Italy&#39;s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini had said that the government is ready to break the EU&#39;s ceiling of 3% debt-to-GDP ratio, which triggered a sharp decline in Italian bond yields and have been affecting negatively on the common currency. As Yohay Elam, FXStreet&#39;s own Analyst explains: &ldquo;The common currency is also suffering from its issues. Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini, which is the de-facto PM, refused to raise the VAT, a measure agreed with the European Commission.&rdquo; He further added, &ldquo;investors are selling off Italian bonds and running to the safety of German ones. The spread between the yields has reached its highest in three months, and the negative German 10-year yield is also wreaking havoc on the euro.&rdquo; Meanwhile, a sudden change in the risk sentiment helped the US Treasury bond yields to witness a sharp intraday bounce, which eventually provided a minor lift to the US Dollar and further collaborated to the pair&#39;s latest leg of the slide over the past few hours. Moving ahead, Thursday US economic docket features some second-tier releases - housing market data, the usual initial weekly jobless claims and Philly Fed Manufacturing Index, which might be looked upon to grab some short-term trading opportunities.

However, 5-Star support has steadily slid and it is now polling below a reinvigorated centre-left PD.&rdquo; &ldquo;Right-wing Lega now leads polls and so Salvini moved to increase this stance into next week&rsquo;s EU parliamentary elections by raising the potential of populist expansionary policies that could split the tense coalition and breach EU budget constraints. The widening of factions within the coalition are driving BTP-Bund spread back towards the extremes seen in late 2018 and also risk driving EUR lower.&rdquo; &ldquo;Eurozone data continue to show economic stabilisation and ECB officials have stressed that the &ldquo;green shoots&rdquo; have affirmed the potential of achieving their forecasts and goals. Although the delay in US auto sanctions for 6 months is supportive, the rebound in EU activity is vulnerable and political strains during the EU elections are likely to weigh on core Eurozone yields and EUR.&rdquo; &ldquo;The EU election period should restrict EUR/USD rebounds which seems unlikely to push towards 1.13.

The EUR/USD pair quickly reversed a dip to fresh two-week lows, albeit lacked any strong follow-through and remained well below the daily tops. The pair extended this week&#39;s downward trajectory and remained on the defensive through the mid-European session amid fiscal risks related to Italy, particularly after the country&#39;s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said that the government is ready to break the EU&#39;s ceiling of 3% debt-to-GDP ratio. Adding to this, the US Dollar regained some positive traction, climbing to the 98.00 handle in the last, further collaborated to the downward momentum and dragged the pair to an intraday low level of 1.1158, albeit the latest trade-related headlines helped limit any further downside. A White House statement said that the US President Donald Trump has delayed a decision on imposing tariffs on cars made by the European Union and Japan for 180 days, which was seen as one of the key triggers behind the pair&#39;s modest bounce in the last hour or so.

German finance ministry expects manufacturing to remain subdued. On Sunday, ECB&rsquo;s Knot voiced concerns over weak inflation. EUR/USD hit a 2.5-week low of 1.1153 in Asia and could drop to the psychological level of 1.10 in the near-term if the Eurozone preliminary PMIs, due this Thursday, miss expectations, accentuating growth concerns. The news hit the wires last week that the US President Trump is considering delaying the decision on auto imports tariffs by six months. The EUR, however, failed to pick up a bid and registered losses on each of the previous five trading days. The inability to cheer the tariffs news indicates the concerns about the future economic activity are extremely elevated, as stated by BK Asset Management&rsquo;s Kathy Lien. These concerns would be bolstered, sending EUR/USD down to 1.10, if the widely tracked Eurozone and German preliminary Purchasing Managers&rsquo; indices, scheduled for release, this Thursday, miss estimates. The German Markit Manufacturing PMI (May) is forecasted to rise slightly to 45.0 from the previous month&rsquo;s print of 44.4. As for today, the shared currency will likely remain on the defensive, as the German finance ministry&rsquo;s monthly report released over the weekend said the external risks for the economy remain high and so the manufacturing outlook is likely to remain subdued. Further, European Central Bank (ECB) policymaker Klass Knot one Sunday said that inflation is not at the level the central bank wants it to be and the only thing the bank can do is to keep the pressure up, to make sure the economy performs at high levels of capacity. The EUR/USD pair, however, may pick up a bid in the North American session if Fed&rsquo;s Powell, scheduled to speak at 23:00 GMT, sounds dovish, leading to broad-based USD weakness.
