rge in light of the upcoming EU parliamentary elections, where the focus of attention will be on the potential increase of the populist option among voters. EUR/USD levels to watch At the moment, the pair is retreating 0.05% at 1.1226 and faces the next support at 1.1183 (low Apr.2) followed by 1.1176 (low Mar.7) and finally 1.1118 (monthly low Jun.20 2017). On the upside, a breakout of 1.1254 (high Apr.1) would target 1.1277 (21-day SMA) en route to 1.1338 (200-week SMA).EUR/USD tumbles further, challenges 1.1200The selling pressure now gathers traction around EUR. The greenback pushes higher to the 97.30 region. ECB noted trade tensions morphed into further uncertainty. The offered tone around the European currency keeps picking up pace in the second half of the week and is now dragging EUR/USD to the vicinity of 1.1200 the figure, or fresh 4-week lows. EUR/USD in 4-week lows Spot came under renewed and strong selling pressure following a pick up in the demand for the greenback, particularly after weekly Initial Claims rose by 202K WoW, the lowest level since 1969. Still on the US docket, Challenger Job Cuts rose at a yearly 0.4% during March, or by 60.59K. Furthermore around EUR, the ECB minutes noted members said rising uncertainty is tracking trade tensions, while the Council expects solid economic growth to make a comeback later in the year. According to the minutes, some members favoured an extension of the status quo in rates through the Q1 2020. In the meantime, the pair appears to have resumed the underlying bearish trend despite President Trump said (tweeted) that US-China talks seem to be going well. What to look for around EUR In spite of the ongoing corrective rebound, EUR remains under pressure following poor results in Euroland. In fact, recent disappointing readings in the region somehow confirm that the slowdown in the bloc and the &lsquo;patient-for-longer&rsquo; stance from the ECB could be among us for longer than expected. Against the backdrop of souring risk-appetite trend, the greenback should emerge stronger and is expected to keep weighing on spot for the time being. On the political front, headwinds are expected to emerge in light of the upcoming EU parliamentary elections, where the focus of attention will be on the potential increase of the populist option among voters. EUR/USD levels to watch At the moment, the pair is retreating 0.12% at 1.1218 and faces the next support at 1.1183 (low Apr.2) followed by 1.1176 (low Mar.7) and finally 1.1118 (monthly low Jun.20 2017). On the upside, a breakout of 1.1254 (high Apr.1) would target 1.1277 (21-day SMA) en route to 1.1338 (200-week SMA).When is the German industrial production and how could it affect EUR/USD?Overview &ndash; German Industrial Production Germany, Eurozone&rsquo;s economic power-house, will publish its industrial production figures for the month of February at 0600 GMT today. The data is expected to show that the industrial sector activity rebounded 0.5% m/m in February versus a 0.8% drop seen in January while on an annualized rate, the industrial output had dropped 3.3% in January. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the German factory orders disappointed in February again, falling for the fourth straight month, mainly due to the negative impact of a global trade war, with exports and manufacturing activity particularly hard-hit. Meanwhile, the German Economy Ministry noted earlier this week that &ldquo;manufacturing momentum will continue to be subdued in the coming months, particularly due to lacking external demand&rdquo;. How could it affect EUR/USD? Despite the latest recovery in the German 10-year bond yields, German recession fears continue to haunt the markets, with the risks skewed to the downside for the EUR/USD pair, as it trades near yearly lows heading into the key US payrolls data due later on Friday. A negative surprise in the German industrial figures would intensify these fears, knocking-off the EUR/USD pair to 2019 lows of 1.1177, a break below which the sellers would gain momentum targeting the June 2017 lows of 1.1120. On the other hand, a better-than-expected reading could alleviate concerns of a slowdown in the Eurozone&#39;s largest economy, extending the minor corrective bounce towards 1.1250 levels, beyond which a test of 1.1300 looks likely. Key Notes: EUR/USD analysis: heading into the US NFP report at yearly lows ECB rate hike timing pushed further back again &ndash; Reuters poll US: Nonfarm payrolls to increase 190k in March &ndash; Goldman Sachs About German Industrial Production The Industrial Production released by theStatistisches Bundesamt Deutschlandmeasures outputs of the German factories and mines. Changes in industrial production are widely followed as a major indicator of strength in the manufacturing sector. A high reading is seen as positive (or bullish) for the EUR, whereas a low reading is seen as negative (or bearish).EUR/USD Technical Analysis: Mildly bid towards 1.1250 horizontal resistance, 1.1200 acts as immediate supportEUR/USD is on the bids around 1.1230 ahead of the European open on Friday. Pair&rsquo;s reversal from 1.1200 horizontal-support connecting multiple highs during April 02 signals brighter chances of its advances to 1.1250 resistance including current month tops. Should prices manage to clear 1.1250 upside barrier, 1.1270 and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of its March 20 to April 02 decline, at 1.1270, may become buyers&rsquo; favorites. Though, 1.1300 and 1.1330/35 could challenge bulls past-1.1270, if not then 1.1360 and 1.1390 can offer intermediate halts during an upward trajectory towards 1.1410 and 1.1450. Meanwhile, pair&rsquo;s dip beneath 1.1200 highlights 1.1180 and 61.8% Fibonacci expansion (FE) level of 1.1160 as important supports. If at all bears dominate the price sentiment under 1.1160, a descending trend-line connecting low marked during August and November 2018, at 1.1080, could gain market attention.

Volume, instead, shrunk by nearly 56K contracts, reversing the prior build. EUR/USD still risks further downside The performance around EUR/USD remains choppy so far this week. Spot keeps navigating the lower bound of the recent range against the backdrop of alternating trends in both open interest and volume. That said, while further consolidation is expected in the near term, another test of the 1.1180 region cannot be ruled out for the time being.German industrial production rebounds 0.7% m/m in February, beats estimatesIndustrial production in Germany stalled its run of declines and staged an upturn in February, the official data showed on Friday; calming fears of a slowdown in Europe&#39;s largest economy. Output rose 0.7% m/m, the federal statistics authority Destatis said in figures adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects - well past a 0.5% rebound expected and -0.8% last. On an annualized basis, the German industrial production arrived at -0.4% versus -3.3% booked in January.EUR/USD: Range bound &#8211; Danske BankKristoffer Kj&aelig;r Lomholt, senior analyst at Danske Bank, points out that the EUR/USD pair has traded in a tight range of around 1.1200-1.1250 this week, as the bout of global data releases and news has not offered much argument of a change in either direction. Key Quotes &ldquo;On the one hand, better data out of China and hints of a trade deal has supported EUR/USD; on the other hand, news that Italy&rsquo;s budget deficit will be higher this year along with a pickup in short-term US rates has countered this effect.&rdquo; &ldquo;If we are right in our call for another solid US labour market report today, the market will likely be inclined to further price out Fed cuts, which should give some short-term support to USD.&rdquo;EUR/USD probing daily highs near 1.1230 ahead of NFPThe pair moves higher early in Europe, tests 1.1230. The greenback eases from highs and approaches 97.20. German Industrial Production expanded 0.7% MoM in February. The mood around the European currency remains choppy so far this week, with EUR/USD at least managing to stay above the 1.1200 handle in the last sessions. EUR/USD looks to risk trends, data Spot is so far reversing Thursday&rsquo;s pullback amidst a broad-based sideline theme, always navigating the lower end of the weekly range and with gains capped in the 1.1250 region for the time being. In the meantime, the pair has practically ignored auspicious developments from the US-China trade front, focusing instead in the performance of yields in Germany and the spread vs. their American counterparts. In the data space, German Industrial Production unexpectedly expanded at a monthly 0.7% during February, coming in above expectations and reversing the previous 0.8% contraction. Later across the pond, Non-farm Payrolls for the month of March are expected to grab all the attention. What to look for around EUR Despite the current lack of direction in spot, EUR remains under pressure following poor results in Euroland as of late. In fact, recent disappointing readings in the region somehow confirm that the slowdown in the bloc and the &lsquo;patient-for-longer&rsquo; stance from the ECB could be among us for longer than expected. Against the backdrop of souring risk-appetite trend, the greenback should emerge stronger and is expected to keep weighing on spot for the time being. On the political front, headwinds are expected to emerge in light of the upcoming EU parliamentary elections, where the focus of attention will be on the potential increase of the populist option among voters. EUR/USD levels to watch At the moment, the pair is gaining 0.10% at 1.1231 and a breakout of 1.1254 (high Apr.1) would target 1.1278 (21-day SMA) en route to 1.1338 (200-week SMA). On the flip side, the next support emerges at 1.1183 (low Apr.2) followed by 1.1176 (low Mar.7) and finally 1.1118 (monthly low Jun.20 2017).EUR/USD Technical Analysis: Remains sidelined near term. Another drop to 1.1180 stays well on the cardsEUR/USD remains unable to surpass weekly highs in the 1.1250 region, sparking some sideline trading as a consequence. Extra gains to, initially, the key 200-week SMA at 1.1338 should come if spot manage to clear the mid-1.1200s. On the broader scenario, the near/medium term negative outlook on the pair stays unaltered while below the 6-month resistance line, today at 1.1383.

EUR/USD looks to test 1.1150 or 1.1300 on US payrolls data release. The EUR/USD pair extends its choppy trend in the European session, having stalled its steady recovery near 1.1240 region, as the bulls await the US labor market report for fresh trading impetus. Nonfarm Payrolls Preview: Jobs, claims and sentiment The spot extends its typical pre-NFP caution trading so far this Friday, defending the bids around the 1.1230 level, as markets turn cautious and refrain from placing any big bets on the greenback heading into the US NFP release. Markets are expecting the US economy to have 180k jobs last month when compared to a meager 20k increase seen in February. A bigger-than-expected increase in the US jobs numbers could trigger a fresh USD rally across the board amid beliefs that the US labor market remains stronger and the February dismal report was just a one-off thing. A strong US jobs report could keep the bets for at least one Fed rate hike intact for this year. Valeria Bednarik, Chief Analyst at FXStreet notes: &ldquo;The EUR is among the weakest,which means that, even in the case of a poor US employment report, chances of a solid advance are quite a few. A terrible report could prompt some profit taking from the latest USD rally, therefore help the pair advance. The upward move, however, could be short-lived.&rdquo; In the meantime, the common currency continues to derive some support from upbeat German industrial production data that rebounded 0.7% m/m in Feb vs. 0.5% expectations and 0.0% last while the upside remains capped amid higher Treasury yields.
