The greenback is holding on above the 97.00 handle. ECB minutes next of relevance in the calendar.

EUR/USD shed gains on German data, looks to ECB Spot is advancing for the second session in a row on Thursday after bottoming out in the sub-1.1200 region on Tuesday. Better conditions in the risk-associated universe on the back of fresh optimism around the US-China trade talks and some positive headlines around Brexit has been sustaining the bounce in spot from lower levels. However, EUR faded earlier gains to the vicinity of 1.1250 after German Factory Orders unexpectedly contracted at a monthly 4.6% during February, missing forecasts and falling deeper into the negative ground after January&rsquo;s 2.1% contraction.

What to look for around EUR In spite of the ongoing corrective rebound, EUR remains under pressure following poor results in Euroland. In fact, recent disappointing readings in the region somehow confirm that the slowdown in the bloc and the &lsquo;patient-for-longer&rsquo; stance from the ECB could be among us for longer than expected.

On the other hand, immediate contention emerges at 1.1183 (low Apr.2) followed by 1.1176 (low Mar.7) and finally 1.1118 (monthly low Jun.20 2017).EUR/USD Technical Analysis: Corrective upside could test the 200-week SMA at 1.1338The squeeze higher in the pair still has legs, although spot is struggling to leave behind the area of weekly tops around 1.1250. The 10-day SMA at 1.1241 also reinforces this area of resistance. If this area is cleared on a convincing fashion, further gains could see the critical 200-week SMA at 1.1338 re-visited in the near term. Further out, the bearish view on EUR/USD stays unchanged as long as the 6-month resistance line, today at 1.1380, caps the upside.
