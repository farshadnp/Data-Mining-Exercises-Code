US-China trade talks continue to drive sentiment. German Factory Orders expanded 0.6% MoM in March. The upbeat mood around the European currency stays unchanged so far this week and is now propping the move higher in EUR/USD to the 1.1220 region, or weekly highs. EUR/USD looks to trade, data The pair is up for the third consecutive session on Tuesday, backed by hopes of an eventual trade agreement between US and China despite the recent escalation in tensions following President Trump&rsquo;s threats of imposing extra tariffs. Global markets, and the risk-associated universe in particular, managed well to leave behind the pessimism that emerged at the beginning of the week in response to Trump&rsquo;s comments over the weekend, motivating spot to extend the bounce off Friday&rsquo;s lows near 1.1130. In the data space, German Factory Orders expanded less than expected at a monthly 0.6% during March. Later in the session and across the pond, the IBD/TIPP index, JOLTs Job Openings and speeches by Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan and Quarles should keep the attention on the buck. What to look for around EUR Recent data in Euroland and Germany allowed market participants to believe that some healing process could be under way in the region amidst the ongoing slowdown. However, this scenario needs confirmation in the next months, while the current &lsquo;neutral/dovish&rsquo; stance from the ECB is expected to persist for the reminder of the year and probable H1 2020. The broad-based risk-appetite trends and USD-dynamics are posed to rule the sentiment surrounding the European currency for the time being, all in combination with the onoging US-China trade dispute and potential US tariffs on EU products. On the political front, headwinds are expected to emerge in light of the upcoming EU parliamentary elections in late May, as the populist option in the form of the far-right and the far-left movements appears to keep swelling among voting countries. EUR/USD levels to watch At the moment, the pair is gaining 0.15% at 1.1215 and a break above 1.1264 (high May 1) would target 1.1269 (55-day SMA) en route to 1.1323 (high Apr.17). On the other direction, the next support lines up at 1.1135 (low May 3) seconded by 1.1109 (2019 low Apr.26) and finally 1.0839 (monthly low May 11 2017).EUR/USD: Market recovering in its range - CommerzbankKaren Jones, analyst at Commerzbank, points out that the EUR/USD pair is currently recovering in its range but remains capped by 55 day ma at 1.1270. Key Quotes &ldquo;For now, we are unable to rule out a retest of the 1.1110 support, but, if seen, we look for this to hold. Be advised that the pattern being traced out is a potential large reversal pattern, we have divergence of the weekly RSI and a 13 count on the weekly chart as well and there is a risk of reversal.&rdquo; &ldquo;Initial resistance is the 100 day ma at 1.1326 and the resistance line at 1.1350 ahead of the 200 day ma at 1.1408. Only above the 200 day ma would this imply reversal.&rdquo; &ldquo;Support at 1.1110 is regarded as the break down point to 2018-2019 support line (connects the lows) at 1.1052, the 1.0963 TD support and the 1.0814/78.6% retracement.&rdquo;EUR/USD slips below 1.1200 handle, fresh session lows&bull; A modest USD uptick prompts some fresh selling at higher levels. &bull; Weaker US bond yields might cap USD gains and limit the downside. The EUR/USD pair failed to capitalize on the early uptick to multi-day tops and slipped below the 1.1200 handle, fresh session lows in the last hour. The pair built on the overnight goodish bounce from the bearish gap opening and gained some follow-through traction on Tuesday. The up-move to 1.1218 area seemed unaffected by the disappointing release of German Factory Orders, which expanded 0.6% month-over-month- less than expected during March. The uptick, however, turned out to be short-lived, rather met with some fresh supply amid a modest pickup in the US Dollar demand. After spending the majority of the early part of Tuesday&#39;s trading session in the negative territory, the USD caught some bids and was seen as one of the key factors behind the intraday slide. Meanwhile, the latest leg of a downfall of around 25-pips lacked any obvious fundamental catalyst. Adding to this, the ongoing slide in the US Treasury bond yields might keep a lid on any runaway USD rally and should help limit any substantial weakness amid absent relevant market moving economic releases. Hence, it would be prudent to wait for a strong follow-through selling before traders start positioning for the resumption of the pair&#39;s prior/well-established bearish trend and a possible slide back towards challenging year-to-datelows support, closer to the 1.1100 round figure mark.

In annualized terms, the industrial production is seen contracting 2.8% in March, having dropped 0.4% in the preceding month. Lead indicators point to weak data Germany&#39;s manufacturing PMI&#39;s had sunk deeper into contraction territory in February and March. Notably, the level of new business from abroad in February had dropped by most since October 2012. Further, new orders had contracted for the sixth straight month in March. While new factory orders rose 0.6% in March from the previous month, the rebound from February&#39;s 4% decline was weaker-than-expected. With lead indicators pointing to a deeper manufacturing sector slowdown in the first quarter, the probability of March industrial production missing estimates is high. Impact on EUR/USD EUR/USD created a bullish engulfing candle on Friday, neutralizing the immediate bearish setup. So far, however, the follow-through has been anything but bullish with the pair consistently failing to find acceptance above Friday&#39;s high of 1.1204. That could change today if the Geman industrial production blows past expectations. The outlook would turn bullish if the spot manages to beat the resistance of the trendline connecting March 20 and April 17 highs. Also, the EUR may show resilience in the face of weak data. After all, German slowdown is not a news anymore and seems to have been priced in by markets. About German industrial production The Industrial Production released by theStatistisches Bundesamt Deutschlandmeasures outputs of the German factories and mines. Changes in industrial production are widely followed as a major indicator of strength in the manufacturing sector. A high reading is seen as positive (or bullish) for the EUR, whereas a low reading is seen as negative (or bearish).FX option expiries for May 8 NY cutFXoption expiries for May 8 NY cut at10:00Eastern Time, via DTCC, can be found below. - EUR/USD: EUR amounts 1.1225 920m 1.1290 1.2bn - GBP/USD: GBP amounts 1.3000 308m 1.3085 588m - USD/JPY: USD amounts 109.50 560m 110.00 666m 111.00 435m 111.20 492m - NZD/USD: NZD amounts 0.6575 313mEUR/USD Technical Analysis: A visit to 2019 lows stays on the cards while below 55-day SMAEUR/USD appears sidelined so far this week, always around the key handle at 1.1200 the figure.

EUR/USD stays vigilant on trade talks The pair remains within a sideline theme so far this week, always gyrating around the 1.1200 handle and closely watching developments from the US-China trade front and US and European money markets. In fact, the prevailing risk aversion in the global markets stays sustained by escalating trade jitters, while the inflows into safer assets have dragged yields of the German 10-year Bund to multi-week lows.

Fed&#39;s Barkin doesn&#39;t expect to see a recession in the U.S. Investors remain on the sidelines waiting for fresh headlines on the U.S.-China trade conflict. For the third straight trading day, the EUR/USD pair is struggling to make a decisive move in either directionand fluctuating in a narrow channel near the 1.12 mark. As of writing, the pair was up 0.15% on a daily basis at 1.1205. The lack of macroeconomic data releases from the euro area and the U.S. on Wednesday caused the trading action to remain subdued. More importantly, the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of this week&#39;s trade talks in Washington between the U.S. and Chinese officials force investors to refrain from making large bets and stay on the sidelines. Earlier today, while speaking at a Q&amp;A session atthe Generation &euro;uro Students&rsquo; Award,European Central Bank PresidentMario Draghisaid that the pressure on nominal wages was increasing but was largely ignored by the participants. On the other hand, the low market volatility is also reflected upon the greenback today with the US Dollar Index staying virtually unchanged on a daily basis a little above the 97.50 mark. Richmond Fed President Barkin today argued that there was no risk of a recession considering how low the unemployment and interest rates were. Thursday&#39;s macroeconomic calendar won&#39;t be featuring any data releases from the euro area. FOMC Chairman Powell&#39;s speech in the second half of the day will be looked upon for fresh impetus. Technical outlook by FXStreet Chief Analyst Valeria Bednarik The EUR/USD pair trades lower in range, offering a neutral-to-bearish stance in its 4 hours chart, as it was again contained by sellers aligned around a bearish 100 SMA, which now extends its decline below the Fibonacci resistance at 1.1220, while technical indicators turned modestly lower around their midlines. The 20 SMA converges with a Fibonacci support around 1.1190, limiting the downside in the short-term. The bearish case should be stronger once below 1.1155, while bulls may take over only if the pair recovers the 1.1280 price zone. Support levels: 1.1190 1.1155 1.1110 Resistance levels: 1.1220 1.1250 1.1280EUR/USD loses traction, slumps to session lows below 1.12Subdued trading action forces the pair to stay in its range. US Dollar Index rises modestly in the NA session. Friday&#39;s inflation data from the U.S. is likely to be the next significant catalyst. The EUR/USD pair failed to gather momentum above the 1.12 handle and changed its course in the American trading hours and slumped to a session low of 1.1183. Nevertheless, the fact that there wasn&#39;t a fundamental driver behind this recent action suggests that it&#39;s unlikely to deepen. As of writing, the pair was virtually unchanged at 1.1190. The shared currency on Wednesday stayed relatively resilient against its rivals in the absence of significant macroeconomic data releases from the euro area. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi didn&#39;t deliver any remarks that could have triggered a reaction from the markets either. While speaking at a Q&amp;A session at the Generation &euro;uro Students&rsquo; Award, Draghi said that the ECB would lose its credibility if it were to change its inflation target and noted that the pressure on nominal wages was increasing. In the second half of the day, investors stayed on the sidelines while waiting for fresh headlines surrounding the U.S.-China trade dispute. White House spokeswoman Sanders during the daily press briefing said they have received an indication that China was willing to make a trade deal. The US Dollar Index, which has been moving up and down in a tight range since the start of the week, moved higher toward the upper half of its weekly range and was last up 0.1% on the day at 97.65. The only data from the euroarea in the remainder of the week will be the trade balance from Germany on Friday. For the greenback, Friday&#39;s inflation reportis likely to be the next significant catalyst.

EUR/JPY selling to keep EUR/USD gains under check. The sell-off in CNH, a global anchor, will likely keep the USD better bid against most majors. With both EUR/JPY and the Chinese yuan hitting four-month lows, the EUR/USD pair may continue to trade in a sideways manner around 1.12. &quot;China broke trade deal&quot;, President Trump said while speaking at a rally in Florida and vowed not to back down until China stops cheating US workers. His comments pushed the S&amp;P 500 futures lower in Asia and triggered selling in Asian equities. As a result, the bid tone around the anti-risk JPY strengthened further, pushing the EUR/JPY pair down to 122.91, the lowest level since Jan. 4. It is worth noting that China has vowed to retaliate with tit-for-tat measures if the US goes ahead with the planned hike in tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on Friday. With trade tensions escalating, the EUR/JPY pair may continue to trade in the red in Europe and the weak tone will likely spill over to the EUR/USD market, keeping the gains under check. Further, the offshore yuan (CNH), which hit a four-month low of 6.8334 per US Dollar in the Asian session, may extend the decline further, helping the greenback stay bid against the EUR and other majors. Even so, caution is warranted on the part of the EUR sellers, as despite Trump&#39;s trade rhetoric, the Chinese are starting two days of negotiations with the US and positive comments by Beijing or Washington, if any, could yield a sudden bullish move in both the EUR/JPY and CNH, leading to a move higher in EUR/USD.

In the meantime, markets remain focused on the US-China trade dispute amidst the recent deterioration in talks and ahead of the visit of Chinese negotiators to Washington in order to resume talks and hope for a deal sooner rather than later. In addition, and still on the trade scenario, investors will be closely following events in Washington as an increase in tariffs for Chinese products (from 10% to 25%) worth $200 billion is expected to kick in tomorrow.

US Dollar Index slumps below 97.30. Markets don&#39;t seem to be optimistic about today&#39;s trade talks. After having struggled to make a decisive move above the 1.12 handle since the start of the week, the EUR/USD pair gained traction in the last hour and refreshed its highest level in a week at 1.1252 boosted by the broad USD weakness. As of writing, the pair was up 0.48% on a daily basis at 1.1245. Concerns over China not giving in to the U.S. demands and the Trump administration hiking the tariff rate up to 25% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods seem to be keeping investors away from risk-sensitive assets. The rising demand for safer 10-year Treasury bonds weighed on its yield and forced it to lose more than 2% on the day andfall below the 3-month yield to trigger a USD selloff. The US Dollar Index, which has been moving sideways near mid-97s since the start of the week, was last down 0.27% on a daily basis at 97.35. According to South China Morning Post, ahead of today&#39;s high-level talks in Washington, China&#39;s Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Gao Feng said that China is committed to safeguarding its legitimate rights and interests. Earlier in the day, the data published by the U.S. Census Bureau revealed that the U.S. trade deficit in March widened to $50 billion from $49.3 billion in February but was largely ignored by the market participants. Technical levels to watch for The initial resistance for the pair aligns at 1.1250 (50-DMA/daily high) ahead of 1.1300 (100-DMA) and 1.1325 (Apr. 17 high). On the downside, supports are located at 1.1200 (psychological level/20-DMA), 1.1165 (May 7 low) and 1.1135 (May 3 low).EUR/USD: Upside limited above 1.1265 on trade war risks although US yields weigh on the greenbackSafe haven assets are in demand although the dollar has slipped and the euro popped with US data missing expectations along with US yields sinking, and still underwater despite a mid-session correction. EUR/USD is currently trading at 1.1223 between a range of 1.1173 and 1.1251. Concerns over an escalating US-China trade war and speculation over a North Korean missile launch have given markets a risk-off tone on Thursday. However, the euro has been on the rise in the North America session, brushing off the risk-off tones in markets and building on the positive German data from earlier in the week. German IP rose 0.5% m/m in March marking the third increase for IP in the past four months, though it puts 19Q1 IP growth at just 0.5%. In contrast, US IP was a miss today and U.S. Census Bureau also revealed that the U.S. trade deficit in March widened to $50 billion from $49.3 billion in February.However, the key focus stays with China and trade talks with the U.S. Sino / US trade updates Investors are buying into bonds which have weighed on 10-year yields today, exposing the downside in the greenback, albeit not likely to keep weighing as demand for US assets will likely remain a theme on expectations of being a safer bet for idle cash all the while trade wars remain a theme and drag on. The notion that China is fully prepared to defend its interests in its trade war with the United States is concerning to market participants and we have already seen the yen edge to a marginal new low of 109.47 today and a further extension lower looks likely as both the US and China renew negotiations with hardened positions, which should ultimately be felt through currencies such as the euro as treated as funding currency to buy back the yen. Trump: It is possible to get a trade deal with China this week, but starting paperwork on tariffs on $325B Chinese importstoday Indeed, hopes for a last-minute trade agreement had been dwindling rapidly and increase of tariffs to 25% from 10% on USD 200bn worth of Chinese goods early Friday (at 12:01am EDT) is likely. China responded on Wednesday that it &quot;will have to take necessary countermeasures&quot; should the US increase tariffs. However, Trump has tried reassuring America that a deal could be done this week and we have seen a slight recovery in risk, although a cautious tone is reverberating around the market and a believe it when we see it attitude is likely to keep markets on red alert and cash idle in safe-havens. Looking ahead Eyes will then turn to the US CPI on Friday and the USD is likely to be marginally more sensitive to an unexpectedly weak CPI than a stronger one. EUR/USD levels EUR/USD is struggling to overcome resistance and remains capped by 55-day ma above today&#39;s high, 1.1250/65 respectively. Analysts at Commerzbank explained, that, for now, they are unable to rule out a retest of the 1.1110 support, but, if seen, they look for this to hold: &quot;Be advised that the pattern being traced out is a potential large reversal pattern. We have divergence of the weekly RSI and a 13 count on the weekly chart as well and hence there is a risk of bullish reversal. Initial resistance is the 100 day ma at 1.1322 and the resistance line at 1.1344 ahead of the 200 day ma at 1.1404. Only above the 200 day ma would this imply a bullish reversal.&quot;EUR/USD technical analysis: Euro breaks to the upside and settles near 1.1220 levelThe recent range finally got broken on a sudden bullish spike.

The headline CPI is anticipated to hold stable at 0.4% month-on-month (m/m) and edge higher to 2.1% yearly rate. Meanwhile, Core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs, is anticipated to rise 0.2% m/m during the reported month, up from 0.1% previous, and also tick higher to 2.1% y/y rate. As analysts at TD Securities explained: &ldquo;The main driver behind the monthly gain is another sizable jump in gasoline prices. Furthermore, we anticipate core CPI inflation to register another &quot;soft&quot; 0.2% m/m gain (2.1% y/y), as a firm 0.2% increase in core services prices will likely offset a third consecutive monthly decline in prices in the core goods segment (which we pencil in at -0.1% m/m).&rdquo; Deviation impact on EUR/USD Readers can find FX Street&#39;s proprietary deviation impact map of the event below and as observed, the reaction in case of a relative deviation of +0.98 to -0.98 in the core CPI print is likely to be in the range of 26-25 pips during the first 15-minutes and could stretch to 55-71 pips in the following 4-hours. How could it affect EUR/USD? Yohay Elam, FXStreet&#39;s own Analyst offers important technical levels to watch out for: &ldquo;Initial resistance awaits at 1.1250 which was the high point on Thursday. It is closely followed by 1.1265 that was a high point in early May and had also served as resistance in April. Another cap is 1.1280 which was a support line in April. 1.1330 is next.&rdquo; &ldquo;Initial support awaits at 1.1210 that was a temporary cap last week. It is followed by 1.1165 that held the currency pair up last week. 1.1135 was a swing low last week, and 1.1110 is the current 2019 trough,&rdquo; Yohay added further.
