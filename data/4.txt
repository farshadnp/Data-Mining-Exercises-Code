Key Quotes &ldquo;EUR crosses generally bid yesterday as the lack of trust in ECB&rsquo;s willingness to put action to its words on its easing options provided support. EUR/USD back around the 1.1250 mark, and EUR/GBP failed to move much lower even as the longer Brexit extension arguably reduces the risk of no deal &ndash; instead it drags out uncertainty.&rdquo; &ldquo;A range of global FX vol indices are now back at 2014 levels, hinting that the market is increasingly complacent about risks in either direction. What can drive the next move out of current ranges in the G10 sphere? A trade deal &ndash; which looks increasingly likely given that an enforcement mechanism has reportedly now been agreed upon, and an &ndash; at least moderate &ndash; Chinese recovery could do the trick as this would be a key catalyst for central banks to regain trust in the &lsquo;normalisation&rsquo; process.&rdquo;EUR/USD Technical Analysis: Immediate target on the upside remains at 1.1300 and aboveEUR/USD is extending the weekly upside and is now approaching the key barrier at 1.1300 the figure, regarded as the immediate target. A surpass of this important hurdle should pave the way for a visit to the key 200-week SMA in the 1.1335/40 band. However, as long as the pair remains below the +6-month resistance line, today at 1.1399, the resumption of the bearish mood stays well on the cards, with target at the 1.1180 region (2019 lows).

Will the upside sustain ahead of US prelim UoM consumer sentiment data? The EUR/USD pair caught a fresh bid wave in the European session and broke its consolidative mode to the upside, as the bulls finally conquered the 1.13 handle amid notable US dollar supply across the board. EUR/USD now targets next resistance at 1.1330 The US dollar witnessed another leg lower amid a major turnaround in the risk sentiment, as reflected by the advances in the European equities, US equity futures and Treasury yields that dampened the demand for the safe-haven dollar. Meanwhile, the greenback remains pressured by the latest US media reports, citing that Herman Cain is expected to withdraw from Fed Board of Governors consideration in the coming days. Further, reports that the Fed Chair Powell thinks that the US interest rates are in the right place also collaborated to the broad USD weakness. On the EUR-side of the equation, a smaller-than-expected drop in the Eurozone industrial figures outweighed the reports that the German government is very likely to cut the 2019 German GDP growth forecast by half and bolstered the bullish tone around the shared currency. However, it remains to be seen if the spot can extend the break above the 1.1300 level and test the next upside target of 1.1330 heading into the key US prelim UoM consumer sentiment release due later today at 1400 GMT.

The continuation of the risk-on mood in the global markets is lending extra support to the shared currency and has motivated EUR/USD to break above the key barrier at 1.1300 the figure. EUR/USD now focused on the 200-week SMA Following a strong pick up in the markets&rsquo; appetite for riskier assets in past sessions, the pair is on its way to close the first week with gains after three consecutive weekly pullbacks, including a test of the 1.1180 region. In fact, market participants seems to have already digested the recent dovish message from the ECB and the FOMC minutes, while the absence of significant headlines in the US-China-EU trade front and Brexit talks also contribute to the upbeat mood. In the data space, Industrial Production in the euro bloc contracted 0.2% MoM in February and 0.3% over the last twelve months, both readings surpassing forecasts.

Since then, trends in positioning have diverged, with potential implications for our FX forecasts. Interestingly, sterling short positions have been pared back already, suggesting that our forecast for GBPUSD to move higher as Brexit uncertainty fades could be a little too bullish.&rdquo; &ldquo;The heavy short positions against the euro support our view that the euro could appreciate markedly when (or if for the pessimists out there) economic data start to improve.

Risk reversals have hit three-month highs - a sign of falling demand for puts (bearish bets). EUR/USD may clock three-week highs above 1.1324 in the next few hours as investors are unwinding bearish bets on the common currency. The one-month 25 delta risk reversals (EUR1MRR) are currently trading at -0.125. Indeed, the negative number indicates the demand or the implied volatility premium for the EUR put options (bearish bets) is higher than that for calls (bullish bets). The gauge, however, is currently trading at the highest level since Jan. 10. Further, it has witnessed a near 90-degree rise from lows below -0.60 over the last two weeks. Put simply, the demand or the implied volatility premium for the EUR put options (bearish bets) is currently the weakest in three months and has dropped sharply over the last 2.5 weeks. The data goes well with the fact that the shared currency has found acceptance above the crucial 50-day moving average (MA) line.The common currency, therefore, may extend gains toward the 100-day MA, currently at 1.1345, in the European session. The bullish case looks stronger if we take into account the improved risk appetite in the markets. The major Asian stocks are currently flashing green with Japan&#39;s Nikkei trading at the highest level since Dec. 4. The Shanghai Composite has also gained more than 1 percent. The European stocks may follow suit, more so, as the US has reportedly softened its stance on China&#39;s subsidies in a bid to reach a trade deal next month. The upside in the shared currency, however, may not materialize if the European banking stocks extend Friday&#39;s decline, denting the risk-on sentiment. Further, the dovish comments byECB&#39;s Villeroy could keep the gains in the EUR under check. The spot is currently trading at 1.1312, having found bids at the 50-day MA support of 1.13 in Asia.
