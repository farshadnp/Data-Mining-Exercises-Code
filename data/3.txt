EUR/USD? Ahead of the key release, Yohay Elam, FXStreet&#39;s own Analyst offers important technical levels to trade the major: &ldquo;The 50 Simple Moving Average on the four-hour chart held it down earlier at 1.1235. Further resistance awaits at 1.1255 which was the high point this week. 1.1285 was a temporary high last week, and the peak of 1.1330 is next.&rdquo; &ldquo;Support awaits at 1.1205 which was the low point earlier, and it is followed by the 2019 trough of 1.1176. Further down, we are back to levels last seen in 2017: 1.1115 and 1.1025,&rdquo; he added further. Key Notes &bull;Nonfarm Payrolls preview: no fireworks, but lots of trading opportunities &bull;Non-Farm Payrolls Preview: Jobs, claims, and sentiment &bull;EUR/USD Forecast: Looking afraid of the upside ahead of the Non-Farm Payrolls &bull;EUR/USD choppy around 1.1230, awaits NFP for fresh direction About the US monthly jobs report The nonfarm payrolls released by the US Department of Labor presents the number of new jobs created during the previous month, in all non-agricultural business. The monthly changes in payrolls can be extremely volatile, due to its high relation with economic policy decisions made by the Central Bank. The number is also subject to strong reviews in the upcoming months, and those reviews also tend to trigger volatility in the forex board. Generally speaking, a high reading is seen as positive (or bullish) for the USD, while a low reading is seen as negative (or bearish), although previous months reviews and the unemployment rate are as relevant as the headline figure, and therefore the reaction depends on how the market asses them all.EUR/USD Technical Analysis: Bearish continuation pattern spotted on hourly charts, NFP in focus&bull; The pair struggled to capitalize on this week&#39;s attempted recovery move from sub-1.1200 level and has been oscillating in a narrowing trading band over the past 24-hours or so. &bull; The downside has been finding some support near a short-term ascending trend-line, while upticks remain capped by another descending trend-line extending from March 27 swing highs. &bull; Against the backdrop of the recent downfall, the combination of two converging trend-lines constituted towards the formation of a bearish continuation pennant chart pattern on hourly charts. &bull; Meanwhile, neutral technical indicators on hourly charts haven&#39;t been supportive of a firm intraday direction but maintained their bearish bias on the daily chart, suggesting further downside. &bull; A convincing break through the pennant support will reinforce the bearish bias and turn the pair vulnerable to accelerate the fall back towards challenging YTD lows, around the 1.1175 region.

The EUR/USD pair held on to its mildly positive tone, albeit remained capped below weekly tops following the release of mixed US monthly jobs report. The US Dollar remained depressed through the early North-American session and failed to attract any buying interest after the headline NFP came in to show that the economy added 196K new jobs during March. This marked a solid rebound from the previous month&#39;s dismal reading of 20K and was also better than consensus estimates pointing to an addition of 180K jobs. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate held steady at 3.8% during the reported month but the positive readings were largely offset by weaker average hourly earnings data, coming in to show a 0.1% m/m growth as compared to 0.3% expected and thus did little to impress the USD bulls. Meanwhile, a goodish pickup in the US Treasury bond yields helped limit any meaningful USD weakness and now seemed to be the only factor that might keep a lid on any runaway rally for the major. With today&#39;s US macro data out of the way, market participants now look forward to any fresh US-China trade-related headlines for some meaningful trading impetus.

Key Quotes &ldquo;It is our view that the US economy is at risk of slipping into technical recession in the latter half of 2020. This implies that we are preparing for a set of data disappointments from the US in the months ahead. Despite this view, we expect the USD to remain reasonably firm.&rdquo; &ldquo;USD has been performing a safe haven function such that a strong decline in risk appetite which triggers a dis-investment from emerging markets benefits the USD. Although it can be argued that the USD credentials as a safe haven are blighted by the US&rsquo;s current account and budget deficits, the greenback has liquidity on its side. It remains the global reserve currency and an increasing number of foreign currency debt has been issued in USD in recent years which equates to the potential for increased demand. For many practical reasons the USD serves the purpose of safe haven currency very well for a large number of investors around the globe and these reasons are likely to be given a boost by the relatively attractive yield on offer compared with the traditional safe havens which are the JPY and the CHF.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the coming weeks there is the possibility that risk appetite will be lifted if the US and China manage to stage a signing ceremony signalling a compromise in their trade war. In the first instance relief could lift demand for risky assets and depress the value of the USD.&rdquo; &ldquo;In addition to US/China tension, concerns about slowing growth in the Eurozone and the possibility of more policy accommodative from ECB is also a USD positive factor. With the exception of the Norges Bank, the market&rsquo;s expectations for all G10 central banks has turned more dovish this year and this also shines a relative positive light on the USD. On a 6 month view we see scope for a move towards EUR/USD1.10.&rdquo;EUR/USD Technical Analysis: Choppy Friday keeps the single currency supported above 1.1200 handleEUR/USD daily chart EUR/USD is trading in a bear trend below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA).

According to Valeria Bednarik, Chief Analyst at FXStreet the dailychart shows price below all of its moving averages, with the 20 SMA losing downward strength at around 1.1280, &ldquo;but the longer ones heading firmly south above this last.&rdquo; She adds that Technical indicators attempted a recovery but failed within negative levels and resumed their declines, keeping the risk skewed to the downside. &ldquo;The key levels remain 1.1175 the yearly low being the immediate support, ahead of 1.1120 and 1.1060. To the upside, the mentioned 1.1280 and 1.1330 levels are the ones to watch, with a break above the latest one favoring a corrective movement up to 1.1400&rdquo;, added Bednarik.EUR/USD Technical Analysis: This MA hurdle may hold the key for a notable corrective bounceEUR/USD&#39;s post-Fed sell-off from the high of 1.1448 ran out of steam at 1.1184 on April 2. However, a strong corrective bounce continues to remain elusive with upside consistently being capped by 4H 50-candle moving average (MA), currently located at 1.1231. 4-hour chart As seen in the above chart, the persistent rejection at the 50-candle MA on April 3-4 was followed by a drop to 1.1206. A subsequent attempt to produce a stronger oversold bounce also failed with the pair running into offers above the key average line on Friday. So, a convincing move above that newfound average resistance of 1.1231 may entice buyers, leading to a quick move above 1.13. On the other hand, another rejection, if followed by a move below 1.12, could yield a drop to fresh multi-year lows below 1.1176 (Mach 7 low).
