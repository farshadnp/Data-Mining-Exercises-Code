Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs strategists expect little downside in the American Dollar in the near-term and see the EUR/USD pair falling to the psychological support of 1.10 in the next three months. The shared currency is currently trading at 1.1150 with the German 10-year bund yield below zero. The investment bank favors pro risk USD neutral trades, emerging market (EM) currencies with funding from the EUR or low-yielding EM currencies.Bets against Euro hit highest level since December 2016Large currency speculators boosted their bearish bets on the shared currencyto highest in over two years in the week ended April 23, according tothe latest Commitment of Traders (COT) data released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday. The total net position in non-commercial futures contracts traded by large speculators and hedge funds stood at -105,418 contracts &ndash;the highest since December 2016 when the total was -114,556 contracts. Traders seemingly boosted bearish bets in response to a string of weak Eurozone economic data and upbeat US retail sales released during the reporting period.EUR futures: deeper pullback looks unlikelyIn light of preliminary figures for EUR futures markets from CME Group, investors added nearly 1.7K contracts to their open interest positions on Friday from Thursday&rsquo;s final 511,041 contracts. In the same line, volume went up by almost 28K contracts, reversing the previous drop. EUR/USD supported near 1.1100&hellip; for now EUR/USD printed fresh yearly lows in the vicinity of 1.1100 the figure on Friday, although it has somehow managed to rebound and reclaim the 1.1150/60 band amidst rising open interest and volume. That said, while spot remains under pressure, a break below recent lows seems unlike in the short-term horizon.EUR/USD: Technical bounce? - CommerzbankKaren Jones, analyst at Commerzbank, notes that the EUR/USD pair has sold off towards and has bounced from 1.1110, the May 2017 low. Key Quotes &ldquo;The rebound has so far been tepid and previous supports at 1.1175/85 will act as immediate resistance ahead of the 20 day ma at 1.1233. Intraday Elliott wave counts are negative and are currently indicating that rallies will terminate circa 1.1195/1/1215. Support at 1.1110 is regarded as the break down point to 2019-2019 support line (connects the lows) at 1.1059, the 1.0963 TD support and the 1.0814/78.6% retracement.&rdquo; &ldquo;Initial resistance is the 100 day ma at 1.1335 and the resistance line at 1.1368 ahead of the 200 day ma at 1.1423. Only above the 200 day ma would this imply reversal.&rdquo;EUR/USD flirting with highs near 1.1170 ahead of dataThe pair adds to Friday&rsquo;s gains near 1.1170. EMU Consumer Confidence, ECB&rsquo;s loan figures next on tap. US PCE, Personal Income/Spending coming up across the pond. The better mood around the single currency is extending into this week and is now lifting EUR/USD to the area of fresh highs near 1.1170. EUR/USD up on USD correction, looks to data Spot trades on a firm note at the beginning of the week, challenging Friday&rsquo;s highs in the 1.1170 region following mixed results from advanced US Q1 GDP. In fact, it is worth recalling that the US economy is seen expanding at an annualized 3.2% during the January-March period, although the lack of traction in inflation keeps worrying investors. In the meantime, spot has managed to rebound from last week&rsquo;s yearly lows in the proximity of the key support at 1.1100 the figure, area last visited in May 2017. However, and despite the current bounce, persistent jitters over the slowdown in the bloc vs. a solid health in the US economy are posed to keep the pair under pressure in the near/medium term. Later in the week, US trade negotiators are expected to resume talks with their Chinese peers in Beijing and in Washington in early May, all preceding the potential Xi-Trump summit in June. Moving forward, ECB&rsquo;s M3 Money Supply and Private Loans are due next seconded by several gauges of confidence/sentiment in the euro region. Across the Atlantic, March&rsquo;s inflation figures measured by the PCE and Personal Income/Spending are also due. What to look for around EUR The broad-based risk-appetite trends and USD-dynamics are posed to rule the sentiment surrounding the European currency for the time being, all in combination with the onoging US-China trade dispute and potential US tariffs on EU products. Recent weak results from key fundamentals in the region plus a now unlikely rebound in the activity in the second half of the year have added to the prevailing concerns that the slowdown in the region could last longer that initially estimated and the ECB is therefore likely to remain &lsquo;neutral/dovish&rsquo; for the foreseeable future (say until mid-2020?). On the political front, headwinds are expected to emerge in light of the upcoming EU parliamentary elections in late May, as the populist option in the form of the far-right and the far-left movements appears to keep swelling among voting countries. EUR/USD levels to watch At the moment, the pair is up 0.16% at 1.1157 and a breakout of 1.1174 (high Arp.26) would target 1.1230 (21-day SMA) en route to 1.1280 (55-day SMA). On the flip side, initial contention emerges at 1.1109 (2019 low Apr.26) seconded by 1.0839 (monthly low May 11 2017) and finally 1.0569 (monthly low Apr.10 2017).EUR/USD Technical Analysis: Spot bounces off 2019 lows near 1.1100. Up move seen as corrective onlyThe pair moved lower to the proximity of the 1.1100 neighbourhood on Friday, recording at the same time fresh YTD lows. The ongoing correction higher is considered as corrective only and the prospect on the pair should remain bearish as long as it trades below the multi-month resistance line, today at 1.1334. This hurdle is reinforced by so far monthly tops and the proximity of the 100-day SMA. Spot needs to overcome this hurdle in order to alleviate the downside pressure. On the resumption of the down move, there are no relevant support levels until de 1.0840 region (May 2017 lows).

Spanish political developments and mixed Eurozone data limit the gains. Focus shifts to US core PCE and personal spending data. The EUR/USDpair stalled its recent bounce once again near the 1.1170 level and from there entered a phase of consolidation in the European trading, with the Spanish political uncertainty combined with mixed Eurozone macro news keeping the EUR bulls slightly cautious. The spot picked up bids near the 1.1140 demand zone in the Asian trades earlier today, as the US dollar remained on the back foot across its main competitors after the first quarter US GDP report revealed some meek details, which re-ignited US economic slowdown concerns in the coming quarters. Markets stay focussed on the outcome of Sunday&rsquo;s Spanish general election, as the &ldquo;Incumbent centrists PSOE easily won the election but lack an absolute majority. Markets would like to see a coalition with market-friendly Ciudadanos. Both parties have a majority together, but both have ruled out cooperation. PM Pedro S&aacute;nchez will form a government with the left-wing Podemos and regional parties from Catalonia and the Basque Country,&rdquo; FXStreet&rsquo;s Analyst, Yohay Elam notes. Hence, the Spanish political development could displease the EUR buyers and keep the upside attempts restricted. Further, the shared currency was weighed down by mixed Eurozone economic data, with upbeat money supply data negated by a dip in the bloc&rsquo;s economic sentiment and confidence gauges. With the Euroland data out of the way, the immediate focus now remains on the US macro releases due later today, including the core PCE price index, personal income and spending data for fresh impetus on the US dollar trades.

EUR/USD now looks to US data Spot is up for the second session in a row at the beginning of the week, trying to put further distance from last week&rsquo;s new YTD lows just above 1.1100 the figure. In fact, some selling pressure around the buck emerged in the wake of mixed results from the US docket on Friday, allowing a respite in the beleaguered risk-associated universe and a rebound in the pair. Earlier in the day, the BCE&rsquo;s M3 Money Supply expanded 4.5% on a year to March and Private Sector Loans rose 3.2% YoY. In addition Business Climate in the euro bloc slipped back to 0.42 in April and Consumer Confidence dropped to -7.9.

Key Quotes: &ldquo;The US has suffered less from the loss of global growth momentum that began towards the end of last year. However, recently US data have surprised on the downside. We see the US economy turning ahead of the eurozone as the latter will need to wait for China to stabilise first and Trump&rsquo;s continued fiscal boost hold a hand under US activity.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Fed is on hold for now. On the one hand, data has not deteriorated to warrant real speculation about rate cuts. On the other hand, weak inflation expectations are keeping the Fed alert. While we now think the Fed is done hiking rates, we think it is too soon for it to start cutting rates.&rdquo; &ldquo;A dovish ECB surprised with new TLTROs and rate guidance that eliminated the likelihood of an ECB hike in 2019, supporting a low EUR/USD for a prolonged period. A trade deal in Q2 would be positive for the eurozone and could pave the way for positive surprises later in 2019, as a lot of negativity is priced in on the euro political side.&rdquo; &ldquo;Price action during the April ECB meeting suggests to us that the market is looking for more than promises before selling the euro from an already short position. A trade deal and a &lsquo;decent Brexit&rsquo; will eventually be positive for the eurozone and could pave the way for positive surprises later in the year as a lot of negativity is priced in on the euro political side.

Overbought RSI levels also flash warning signals for buyers. EUR/USD is struggling around 1.1185 during early Tuesday as overbought conditions of 14-bar relative strength index (RSI) questions the quote&rsquo;s recovery from 1.1110. Not only RSI but 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of its April 17 to 26 downturn and a fortnight-long descending trend-line could also confine pair&rsquo;s near-term advances around 1.1200 mark. In a case where prices cross 1.1200 barrier, 1.1210 and a horizontal line connecting April 18 lows to April 24 highs near 1.1230 might try to limit the upside towards 1.1260 and 1.1280. Should sellers prefer concentrating on RSI and fail to surpass 1.1200, 1.1165 may offer immediate support ahead of highlighting upward sloping support-line near 1.1150. If the pair slip beneath 1.1150, 1.1125 and 1.1110 can gain bears&rsquo; attention.

The corrective bounce could be capped by tighter Italy-German yield spreads. Recent lows could again come into play if the German employment, inflation numbers and the Eurozone GDP print below estimates. EUR/USD&#39;s corrective bounce could be short-lived if the key German data, due for release today, print below estimates. The shared currency jumped 0.41 percent on Monday and closed above the former support-turned-resistance of 1.1176, possibly in response to a six basis point drop in the spread between the US and German two-year government bond yields on Friday. While a close above 1.1176 has neutralized the immediate bearish outlook, a stronger corrective bounce above 1.12 may remain elusive if the Italy-German 10-year yield spread extends the 16 basis point drop seen over the last two trading days. The Italy-German yield differential, however, may take a back seat if the key German and Eurozoneeconomic data releases paint a positive picture of their respective economies. The data due at 07:55 GMT is expected to show the German economy shed 6K jobs in April and the seasonally adjusted Unemployment Rate remained steady at 4.9%. Meanwhile, Eurozone&#39;s first quarter GDP is forecasted to have risen 0.3%quarter-on-quarter and 1.1%year-on-year. That data is scheduled for release at 09:00 GMT. The EUR may rise to 1.12 or higher if the German jobs data and the Eurozone GDP beat estimates. The rise, however, could be reversed if Germany&#39;s preliminary consumer price inflation (CPI), due at 12:00 GMT, prints below the estimate of a 0.5% month-on-month rise, validating the European Central Bank&#39;s (ECB) dovish stance. As of writing, the EUR/USD pair is trading at 1.1187, representing marginal gains on the day. It is worth noting that China&#39;s private and official Manufacturing PMIs released in Asia showed the sector barely expanded in April. As a result, the equities may remain on the defensive, capping the upside in the EUR ahead of the key data releases.

The buying interest around the single currency seems to be losing some momentum on Tuesday and is motivating EUR/USD to probe the 1.1180/75 band ahead of the opening bell in the Old Continent. EUR/USD looks to upcoming data Following two consecutive daily advances, spot has now met some selling pressure after climbing to the vicinity of 1.1200 the figure during early trade. Poor Chinese PMI results appear to have dented the recent renewed optimism in the risk-associated universe somewhat, removing tailwinds from the up move. In the meantime, the pair is expected to join the broader consolidative fashion in the very near term ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s FOMC meeting and Friday&rsquo;s release of US Non-farm Payrolls for the month of April. In the docket, German Import Prices came in flat on a monthly basis during March and rose 1.7% from a year earlier. On the brighter side, May&rsquo;s Consumer Climate tracked by GfK came in at 10.4, bettering expectations and matching the previous reading. Later in the session, the shared currency is expected to remain in centre stage in light of the publication of the German labour market figures and advanced CPI for the month of April. Further data will see another revision of Q1 GDP in the broader euro area.

The consensus amongst traders expects the bloc&rsquo;s economic growth to come in a tad firmer at 0.3% inter-quarter in Q1, while on an annualized basis, is expected to steady at 1.1%. Deviation impact on EUR/USD Readers can find FX Street&#39;s proprietary deviation impact map of the event below. As observed the reaction is likely to remain confined between 10 and 70 pips in deviations up to 4 to -2.5, although in some cases, if notable enough, a deviation can fuel movements of up to 120-130 pips. How could affectEUR/USD? At the press time, the EUR/USD pair trades near 1.1185 levels, having changed course and spiked to 1.1195 highs after the Spanish Q1 preliminary GDP rate arrived at 0.7% q/q vs. 0.6% expected. From a technical perspective, a stronger Q1 first Eurozone GDP reading could add extra legs to therenewed upside in EUR/USD, fuelling a break above the 1.1200 barrier. A sustained move above the last could open doors for a test of 1.1230/34 (20-DMA/ April 24 high) and 1.1275 (50-DMA). On the flip side, a negative surprise could drag the spot back to 1.1160 (5-DMA), below which the next supports are aligned at 1.1142 (April 29 low) and 1.1111 (2019 lows).

Immediate target to the upside remains at the 10-day SMA ahead of the 21-day SMA at 1.1204 and 1.1230, respectively. Of more relevance, the 55-day SMA is located at 1.1278 and is considered the last defence for a test of April tops in the low-1.1300s. In the meantime, the current squeeze higher is considered as corrective only and the outlook on spot should stay negative while below the multi-month resistance line, today at 1.1325. This hurdle is reinforced by the proximity of the 100-day SMA. Downside pressure should mitigate above this area.

EMU advanced Q1 GDP surprised to the upside. German flash inflation figures next of relevance. The upbeat tone in the single currency remains well and sound on Tuesday and is now lifting EUR/USD to levels beyond 1.1200 the figure, or weekly highs. EUR/USD bid after data, looks to German CPI Spot is extending the sharp rebound from last week&rsquo;s lows in the 1.1100 neighbourhood, gaining around a cent to the area above the key barrier at 1.1200 the figure. EUR moves higher amidst an intensification of the selling pressure around the greenback and positive results from the euro calendar, which have in turn offset the lower-than-expected releases in the Chinese docket earlier in the day. In fact, the German Consumer Climate stayed unchanged at 10.4 for the month of May while the Unemployment Change dropped more than expected by 12K. In addition, the economy of Euroland is seen expanding 0.4% inter-quarter during the January-March period and 1.2% on an annualized basis, while the jobless rate ticked lower to 7.7% in March, all prints coming in above expectations. What to look for around EUR The broad-based risk-appetite trends and USD-dynamics are posed to rule the sentiment surrounding the European currency for the time being, all in combination with the onoging US-China trade dispute and potential US tariffs on EU products. Despite today&rsquo;s Q1 GDP figures surprised to the upside in the euro bloc, the view that the slowdown in the region could last longer that initially estimated remains unchanged for the time being, while the ECB is therefore likely to remain &lsquo;neutral/dovish&rsquo; for the foreseeable future (say until mid-2020?). On the political front, headwinds are expected to emerge in light of the upcoming EU parliamentary elections in late May, as the populist option in the form of the far-right and the far-left movements appears to keep swelling among voting countries. EUR/USD levels to watch At the moment, the pair is gaining 0.23% at 1.1211 and a break above 1.1231 (21-day SMA) would target 1.1278 (55-day SMA) en route to 1.1323 (high Apr.17). On the other hand, immediate support emerges at 1.1109 (2019 low Apr.26) seconded by 1.0839 (monthly low May 11 2017) and finally 1.0569 (monthly low Apr.10 2017).EUR/USD pushes higher post-German CPI, near 1.1230The pair extends the move higher to the 1.1230 region. The greenback accelerates the downside, around 97.50. German flash CPI leaps to 1.0% MoM in April. The bid tone in the European currency remains unchanged so far this week and is now lifting EUR/USD to fresh 4-day highs in the 1.1220/30 band. EUR/USD higher on German data Spot picked up extra pace today after advanced inflation figures in Germany showed consumer prices are expected to rise 1.0% MoM in April and 2.0% from a year earlier. In addition, the broader HICP is seen gaining 1.0% on a monthly basis and 2.1% over the last twelve months. These data sustained further the already upbeat sentiment in EUR and the broader risk-associated complex. It is worth recalling that earlier data releases saw EMU Q1 GDP expected to expand 0.4% QoQ and 1.2% YoY, while Italy&rsquo;s economy is seen returning to the positive ground and expand 0.2% inter-quarter in Q1 and 0.1% YoY. The solid squeeze higher in spot has been sustained by the sharp sell off in the greenback, particularly exacerbated after Friday&rsquo;s data releases and amidst expectations of a dovish message at the FOMC meeting tomorrow. What to look for around EUR The broad-based risk-appetite trends and USD-dynamics are posed to rule the sentiment surrounding the European currency for the time being, all in combination with the onoging US-China trade dispute and potential US tariffs on EU products. Recent EMU Q1 GDP and German inflation figures surprised to the upside, although this could be viewed as a temporary respite amidst the prevailing view that the slowdown in the region could last longer that initially estimated as well as the current &lsquo;neutral/dovish&rsquo; stance from the ECB.

The key event ahead is the FOMC meeting. Today the Fed started its two-day meeting. No change in its policy is expected but the statement and the press conference could have an impact on the US dollar. &ldquo;USD to pare gains ahead of the meeting but the post-Fed reaction unclear.

Levels to watch At the moment, EUR/USD trades a t1.1204 and it is testing the 1.1200 area. The immediate support level could be seen at 1.1195 (20-hour moving average), followed by 1.1175 (Apr 30 low) and 1.1140. On the upside, the recovery today was capped below the 1.1230 area.

Key Quotes: &ldquo;The GDP and employment reports will come as a relief to the European Central Bank which had been criticized in some quarters for phasing out its bond purchase program in December in the face of slowing growth. Trying to reassure market participants, ECB President Mario Draghi had stated at the central bank&rsquo;s last monetary policy meeting that the ECB stood poised to &ldquo;adjust all its instrument&rdquo; if growth continued to disappoint. Although this morning&rsquo;s news suggests such &ldquo;adjustments&rdquo; won&rsquo;t be necessary, we&rsquo;ll have to wait to see core inflation picking up before ruling out the possibility of additional monetary stimulus. No need to say that Friday&rsquo;s advance CPI release for April will be watched closely.&rdquo; &ldquo;Complicating things further for policymakers is the recent weakness of advanced indicators for the eurozone. Markit&rsquo;s manufacturing PMI indeed remained in contractionary territory in April in both France and Germany while the European Commission&rsquo;s Index of Economic Confidence decreased for a tenth consecutive month, dropping 1.6 point to a 31-month low of 104.0. Sinking the index was lower confidence among consumers (-7.9 vs. -7.2 the prior month), hardly the indication of an upcoming pickup in consumer spending. &ldquo; &ldquo;Add to that the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors (think Brexit) and the threat of protectionism and you get a pretty delicate situation for the ECB. It is obviously too soon for the central bank to be talking about an eventual normalization of its policy. Better make sure that the recovery has legs by going ahead with a new phase of subsidized loans to banks (TLTRO III) and the introduction of a tiered system of negative deposit rates designed to alleviate the pressure on European financial institutions that are currently paying the ECB to hold their assets.&rdquo; &ldquo;Looking ahead things are likely to improve. Mind you, we&rsquo;re not calling for stellar growth in the eurozone this year (1.3%), but we feel that too much bad news is being priced in European assets at the moment. This is why we see the euro appreciating in the coming months.&rdquo;EUR/USD technical analysis: Sellers lurk around 1.1225/30 while buyers aim for 1.1260A three-week long horizontal resistance favors the quote&rsquo;s pullback to 23.6% Fibo. The descending trend-line since late-March seems important upside resistance. Although gradual recovery from 1.1110 propelled the EUR/USD pair to a week&rsquo;s high on Tuesday, the quote struggles to extend its upswing by trading around 1.1220 during early Wednesday. At present, lows marked since April-start and a high on April 23 form immediate horizontal resistance around 1.1225/30, a break of which can help buyers to run towards six-week-old descending trend-line, at 1.1260. In a case where prices rally past-1.1260, 50% Fibonacci retracement of March to April downturn, at 1.1280, followed by 1.1320-25 region including 61.8% Fibonacci retracement could lure bulls. Alternatively, 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at 1.1190 could offer adjacent support during the pullback ahead of 1.1160. Additional rests beneath 1.1160 are recent low near 1.1110 and 61.8% Fibonacci expansion (FE) level near 1.1090.

The Fed is expected to keep rates unchanged today and may tilt slightly to hawkish side. EUR/USD closed above the 10-day moving average (MA) on Tuesday, neutralizing the immediate bearish setup ahead of the all-important FOMC rate decision. The currency pair logged its first three-day winning run in over a month with a 0.27% rise as the Eurozone first quarter GDP and the German inflation figure bettered estimated, suggesting the European Central Bank (ECB) may not have to easy policy further anytime soon. A bullish reversal above 1.1324 (April 17 high), however, will likely remain elusive, as the Fed has little room to turn dovish by dropping rate hike hints, given the sustained labor market strength and record highs in stocks. The central bank is expected to keep rates unchanged at 2.25%-2.5% and may put a bid under the greenback by taking note of the recent improvements in the economy. Further, recently released forward-looking Eurozone indicators indicate there is no clear path to above trend growth, according to Greg Gibbs, Analyst at Amplifying Global FX Capital Pty Ltd. That said, the pair may challenge the 50-day moving average, currently at 1.1274, if the Fed sounds dovish.Ahead of the Fed, the pair may take cues from ECB&rsquo;s De Guindos speech and the US ISM manufacturing number. As of writing, the spot is trading largely unchanged in the day at 1.1218.

The USD selling remained unabated through the early North-American session and lifted the EUR/USD pair to fresh one-week top, around mid-1.1200s post-US ISM PMI. The US Dollar did get some respite following the release of robust ADP report - showing that the US private sector employers added 275K new jobs in April, though was largely offset by the latest disappointment from US ISM manufacturing PMI. Meanwhile, a weaker tone around the US Treasury bond yields did little to ease the USD bearish pressure, with the prevalent risk-on mood further driving flows away from the greenback&#39;s perceived safe-haven status and benefitting the shared currency. It, however, remains to be seen if the pair is able to capitalize on the positive momentum or witness some profit-taking amid some repositioning trade ahead of today&#39;s key event risk - the latest FOMC monetary policy update, due to be announced later during the US trading session. Technical outlook Valeria Bednarik, FXStreet&#39;s own American Chief Analyst writes: &ldquo;Technical readings in the 4 hours chart maintain the risk skewed toward the upside, as, despite easing, technical indicators have limited downward strength and hold near overbought levels. The 20 SMA in the mentioned chart keeps advancing below the current level, while the 100 SMA converges with the mentioned Fibonacci resistance.&rdquo;EUR/USD Technical Analysis: Euro pushes to&#160;daily highs near 1.1250 ahead of the FedEUR/USD daily chart EUR/USD is evolving in a bear trend below its main simple moving average (SMAs).

EUR/USD 4-hour chart EUR/USD is challenging the 1.1250 resistance and the 100 SMA. EUR/USD 30-minute chart EUR/USD is trading above its main SMAs suggesting bullish momentum in the short-term. The key resistance to the upside is seen at the 1.1270 level followed by 1.1300 figure if the bulls gather enough steam. Alternatively, a break below 1.1200 would be seen as bearish as it can initially expose 1.1170 and 1.1140 supports.

The new forecasts will be presented in the annual Economic and Financial Document (DEF) due to be issued by Wednesday, which sets the framework for the 2020 budget. The current 2020 deficit target, set in December, is 1.8 percent of GDP, down from 2.04 percent this year, but a recent economic downturn means both years will have to be revised up.
